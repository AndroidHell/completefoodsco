# completefoodsco

This is a backup of the compeletefoods.co DIY Soylent website.

I ran a wget on the site on 01.26.22.

The live site tends to go offline, showing a 503 internal gateway error on a semi frequent basis

I ama pushing this to github to preserve the site

I am in no way affiliated with completefoods.co although I do have a few recipes on the site

This repo is inteded to used for reference purposes
