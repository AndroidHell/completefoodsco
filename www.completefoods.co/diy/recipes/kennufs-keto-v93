<p>##​Keto</p>
<hr>
<p>It&#39;s been a long time coming, but I finally have a keto recipe I&#39;m proud of with <em>Keto v9.3 </em>. I find this delicious, let me know how you like it. :)</p>
<p>I am using Nutrabio flavored proteins (Chocolate-Mint originally, still a favorite), but expect any clean, flavored whey you like will work well. I have found any of NutraBio&#39;s whey flavors (Yep, I&#39;ve tried them all) can be used in the recipe without issue, and mixing some of the flavors brings excellence... Cappuccino and Chocolate are awesome together. Be careful with the Java flavor though, unlike the other flavors which don&#39;t have additives Java is fortified with vitamins and may cause an overage.</p>
<p>I am still fairly new to keto myself, so am still learning. I plan to continue adding to ​this keto section slowly over time as I learn more or find something I think may be of interest to others here. There are varying opinions on ketosis, and I am not trying to convince any here of what is best for them. I do believe though that while no single diet is appropriate for everyone, a ketogenic diet could be beneficial for many of us and should not be dismissed out of hand. I don&#39;t know yet if keto is even right for me, but based on my limited knowledge and experience with it I think that it may provide the improved health in my case.</p>
<p>I would recommend visiting the blog of Peter Attia, <a href="http://eatingacademy.com/start-here">The Eating Academy</a>. He has been practicing a ketogenic diet for most of the last few years as he has gained better control of his health and metabolic disorder. His blog is well written and his development has been well documented.</p>
<p>Another blog, by Joseph Arcita offers a <a href="http://josepharcita.blogspot.com/2011/03/guide-to-ketosis.html">Guide to Ketosis</a> that may help to answer many of your questions.</p>
<p>I would also recommend anyone interested in keto drop by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq">Reddit&#39;s Keto page</a> for lots of awesome information and support.</p>
<p>I no longer use a blender for my recipe, I have found with my newer recipes it is unnecessary, adding additional cleanup I just don&#39;t want to be bothered with. I am using Takeya pitchers that I bought from Soylent to simply shake the mix every evening for the next day. My current recipe (Keto 9.3) emulsifies beautifully, separation is a non-issue with this blend.</p>
<p>More notes on keto are in the <em>Use Log</em> below. Happy soylenting.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve started this journey by mixing the <a href="http://www.cookingfor20.com/2013/06/18/hacker-school-soylent-recipe/">Hacker School</a> soylent to try, but decided that I wanted to make it into a complete recipe, and I also liked the look o​​f <a href="https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/quidnycs-superfood-for-him">QuidNYC&#39;s Superfood.</a> My original recipe was my attempt at a combination of the two. </p>
<p>All of the components could be sourced from Amazon except for the Trader Joe&#39;s Soy P​​rotein. I kept this protein in the recipe as I liked how well fortified it was, if you do choose to go with something else more easily obtained please be sure to adjust for the reduced nutrients. </p>
<p>Please see below for progress updates and tips. The change log is at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>As you can see from this notes page I have been at this a while now, and have written a <a href="http://youtu.be/-mTUmczVdik">plethora</a> of recipes. Currently I am using the latest keto recipe but I have several others linked below if you are not into keto.</p>

<p><strong>For Keto v9.3</strong></p>
<p>I have found it quicker and easier to use the above airtight containers for some of my bulk powder storage, rather than trying to scoop out of the original packaging. </p>
<ul>
<li>Start by setting out all of your ingredients, you will also need a scale, a lightweight bowl large enough to fit your bulkiest ingredient, and something to add your measured ingredients to for mixing. </li>
</ul>
<p>For the dry ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxh-Wi8rX94&amp;src_vid=yajQIHLYlHQ&amp;feature=iv&amp;annotation_id=annotation_3489128281">I have been doing bulk mixing of 10 days worth at a time using this method</a>, then separating it into mason jars for storage and daily use. Typically, I&#39;ll mix 20 or 30 days at a time, which takes an hour or two to complete depending on how involved I am in what&#39;s on TV while I&#39;m working. The mixing container is large enough that with the low volume of powder in this recipe I&#39;m going to try mixing 20 days at a time, but I have been experimenting with different flavors so haven&#39;t needed to do so much bulk mixing lately.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If your using mason jars you can now weigh out the mixed powder so they are ready to go when needed, or you can weigh your powders out daily/weekly/whatever works for you... If your fortunate enough not to be as anal as I am you could just measure it out with a measuring cup, but with the potential variance in powder density I prefer to weigh it out. A days worth of powder should be ~1.4 cups, or ~2.5 Soylent scoops if you have one handy (a Soylent scoop is 135 ml.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the oils:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pour the first oil into the oil jar, tare (zero) your scale and add the second oil, tare again and add the iron, and finally the drops. </li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ve got plenty of space in my fridge, so the powders and oils get to chill next to the bacon until their day comes.</p>
<p><em>As an added bonus my mason jars have volume measurements on the side, giving me a convenient way to measure out the needed heavy cream, and making cleanup much easier than if I had to wash a measuring cup every day.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prior recipes</strong></p>
<p>I typically prepare at least a weeks worth, but prefer to do more. When making changes to the recipe it is better to try it out for a couple of days before committing to a large production run. </p>

<p>This recipe makes just shy of a full quart in dry ingredients. I prefer to use 2 quart resealable containers to do my mixing, they are cheap and reusable, I have also seen large ziplock bags used, but would rather have something reusable. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Originally I had tried adding a days dry ingredients to a mixing bowl and stirring until combined, but found this took to much time. Now I line up a weeks worth of the 2 quart plastic tubs and add a days worth of the dry ingredients, seal them, shake them, and pour them into the 1 quart jars for daily use. This has saved a lot of time during the bulk preparation. You could of course skip adding them to the jars, but I prefer this as it takes less space and I have found it more convenient. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Next, pour the first oil into the oil jar, tare (zero) your scale and add the second oil. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Finish up by storing the dry ingredients in the fridge or freezer, I also keep the oils in the fridge. Refrigeration may not be necessary, but I would rather err on the side of caution, and I don&#39;t need the fridge for muggle food anymore. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="daily">Daily</h4>
<p><strong>For Keto v9.3</strong></p>
<p>When it comes time to mix up a daily batch: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>First add a few inches of water to the pitcher to help prevent the powder caking on the bottom when it gets wet; (I&#39;m using an airtight Takeya that is great when it comes time to shake thing up.) </p>
</li>
<li><p>Then throw in the powder and heavy cream; (I store my powder in canning jars that also have volume marks on the side, which is an easy way to measure the cream without having to wash a measuring cup everyday.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add a little more water and shake it up;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Then add the oils and the remaining water and shake well. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I typically make it late the day before I plan to eat it, but have had it after a few days in the fridge without any issues. Don&#39;t push it too far though, eventually bacteria will take over and the batch will go bad, if you suspect it may have gone bad toss it out.</p>
<p>I have also been asked how much water to use, but it&#39;s pretty much user preference, so feel free to experiment. I tend to have a total mixed volume of ~56oz, in the Takeya pitcher that means there is about 8oz worth of volume (or about 1&quot;) empty at the top after it is mixed.</p>
<p>For cleanup everything goes into the dishwasher, which gets run every 4-5 days. I do recommend having at least two pitchers (I have seven) so that you can mix a new batch even if the current batch isn&#39;t quite finished off.</p>
<p><strong>Prior recipes</strong></p>
<p>I prepare my daily batch the night before. You can mix it on demand, but I have found that it can be a bit more gritty if consumed immediately, as well as being a thinner mixture. I much prefer this recipe cold and well incorporated. The added time also allows the Chia seeds to fully dissolve, which helps the texture and suspension of the mix. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>To start, add at least half of your water to the blender and turn it on low. Slowly pour in the dry mix, if you go too fast some clumps may stick to the side walls and you will need to scrape them into the liquid while blending. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Next, turn the blender to high and pour in the oils. Then add your remaining water. I typically let it run about two minutes total on high, including the time while adding the liquids. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Place the blender jug into the fridge to chill overnight. The batch should have stayed mixed through the night, I have not had any settling issues, but since it is still in the blender jug I will usually throw it back on high for a minute in the morning, though I don&#39;t actually think it is necessary. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep in mind that the Olive oil will freeze in the refrigerator, so it&#39;s best to take it out a little while before mixing the batch. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, enjoy a good, nutritious food throughout your day. </p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Keto v 9.3</em></p>
<p>TLDR: went keto, love keto. KCCO. </p>
<p>I went to this keto soylent about 5 weeks ago... I love it. It&#39;s delicious, and I&#39;m down about another 25 lbs since I made the switch, yeah, I know, 5 or 10 of that was water. While I do control my calories to keep up the weight loss, I&#39;ve found that ketosis seems to be more forgiving to me if I do eat extra, as in if I eat 500 kcal more today than normal I will still be down a bit of weight tomorrow, where before I could have counted on a gain. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve been playing with keto recipes for several months now, and I tried going full into two prior recipes... those attempts didn&#39;t end well. My previous attempts were not palatable enough, and I droped each experiment after about two weeks. This go I am really pleased with the recipe and expect to keep at it for the foreseeable future, though once I do get to my goal weight I may switch to a low carb rather than keto diet, we&#39;ll see. </p>
<p>I&#39;m up to <a href="https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/kennufs-keto-v93-chocolatemint-2">version 9.3</a> (yikes I&#39;ve been after this too long)  and found the flavored whey to be awesome, it really helped get the recipe where I wanted. I&#39;m using <a href="http://www.nutrabio.com/Products/whey-protein-isolate.htm">NutraBio</a> , but I imagine any clean, flavored whey you like would work well. So far I&#39;ve tried almost all of their flavors (only orange left to try, and it&#39;s mixed and chilling for tomorrow) and have been pleased, the original mint in the recipe is still a favorite, the chocolate and vanilla are good, but better when mixed, as is mixing chocolate with cappuccino, yum. My least favorite was the cinnamon bun, followed by banana, but they weren&#39;t bad, and I imagine I&#39;ll be ordering both again. As a bonus, a 2 lb tub is just right to mix up a 10 day bulk batch,  :smile: (cheese puff container FTW, thanks @Chris_Bair) though buying larger tubs of whey is cheaper.</p>
<p>This recipe does use a little bit of heavy cream, which I expect helps the palatability as well, but it can be easily removed without destroying the micros, just add more oil to make up for the lost calories. On that note, you can also easily tailor the calories up or down for your needs by adjusting the oil, if you&#39;re using MCT it will be flavorless. I&#39;ll be trying it without the cream soon, but have really been enjoying it as is and didn&#39;t want to remove it while playing with different flavors of whey, though I expect it will still work well.  </p>
<p>I would advise that if you decide to go this route, you go all in, don&#39;t cheat when you&#39;re eating muggle food. I&#39;ve found it to actually be pretty easy to stick with (haven&#39;t cheated yet, or really even wanted too) even when eating out, most restaurants will have some carb free&#39;ish choices that will keep you on track, and many now offer carb free as an option (had lunch Sunday at Red Robin, they will give you any sandwich on a lettuce bun, and you can substitute a bottomless salad for the fries.) </p>
<p>I&#39;ve never gone through keto flu, and I&#39;ve gone into keto now three times, but many do. Just be ready for a few bad days when you start in case you do, and prepare ahead of time by insuring you&#39;re getting all your electrolytes. </p>

<p><em>Keto v 1.0</em></p>
<p>I was on this keto recipe for a short time (about 3 weeks) and found that my energy level was good and I felt good overall. I personally had no issues with transitioning in and out of ketosis, but some may have trouble. I came off of the recipe due to family obligations that were going to make it difficult to continue at the time, not due to problems with the recipe or ketosis. I actually quite liked the time I was in ketosis and plan to take it up again soon. I am hesitant though because I am expecting my Soylent ship to come in fairly soon, and would like to be able to give it a fair shake without worry of carb content. I found the flavor of the recipe to be OK, but not yet where I would like it to be, it is a work in progress.</p>

<h5 id="2014-2-9">2014-2-9</h5>
<p>####One month update</p>
<p>I have been living on this for a full month now. The first couple of weeks the recipe was a bit spotty as I didn&#39;t yet have all of the ingredients, but I had enough to get started. The last couple of weeks I have been using the full recipe. </p>
<p>So far I have been doing about 90% soylent overall, with most days being only soylent, and occasionally I will have a day with a social meal out. I do expect to have 1-3 traditional meals per week, so going forward soylent should remain about 90% of my diet. </p>
<p>I have liked this well enough to fully commit to it, I currently have a minimum of 3 months ingredients on hand, with a few that will last much longer. I do also have a large supply of Soylent coming, hopefully soon, but at this point I don&#39;t expect to abandon my home recipe to go exclusivity with the official version. I am hoping I like it well enough to keep it on hand as well to supplement my own supply when needed. I expect it will be easier to travel with, as they say it can be mixed on demand, whereas I prefer my mix to sit in the fridge overnight. </p>
<p>So far I am feeling fine, no complaints thankfully, but a few good points. I have noticed my energy being much steadier throughout the day, no more afternoon crashes. Sleep seems to be of a better quality, and getting up is not a problem. </p>
<p>I am not regularly hungry, I tend to have my soylent throughout the day. When I start to feel a bit peckish I will down a few ounces.  I no longer experience food cravings, but since I am getting a much more complete diet I guess I&#39;m not all that surprised. No more cravings, for me at least equals no more binging, which I&#39;m sure helps with weight loss and health overall. Not being hungry, and not having cravings, also means I am not missing food, and of that I am glad.</p>
<p>Improving my health was one of the driving forces behind starting this journey. I have a sedentary job, and don&#39;t have a daily exercise routine, but I do try and stay active through some group activities and sports. Weight has been aissue for me since adolescence, although I stay active enough that I think my overall health is better than my weight suggests. I am down 14 pounds in my first month on soylent, so the trend is going in the right direction. </p>

<h5 id="2014-1-11">2014-1-11</h5>
<p>Those of you wishing to weigh your oil may like to know that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Olive Oil has a density of 0.92 g/ml;</p>
</li>
<li><p>MCT Oil has a density of 0.93-0.96 g/ml;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So for this recipe you would need 20 grams of Olive Oil, and 20 grams of MCT Oil.</p>
<p>Also, while I am not myself vegan, I believe this recipe may be. Please let me know if you see that it is not and I will remove the tag, or update the offending ingredient if feasible.</p>
<p>I will say that this is my third day using the Hacker School soylent, and so far I am enjoying it. I am looking forward to the official shipment of Soylent to come and am curious to see if I will continue down the DIY path or go with the easy order. One of my goals in this is the simplicity.</p>

<p><em>Keto v9.3 </em></p>
<p>After many months of recipe variations, trials, and errors I finally have a keto recipe that is worthy to be eaten and released for public consumption. I find it delicious, let me know if you like it. :)</p>
<p>I am using Nutrabio flavored proteins, but expect any clean, flavored whey you like will work well. I have found any flavor can be substituted for the whey in the recipe without issue, mixing some of the flavors is excellent.</p>

The new <a href="http://www.nutrabio.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Store_Code=NOS&amp;Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=25550">Java Whey from NutriBio</a> has a nice flavor and I think enhances the recipe.</p>
<p>Much thanks to QuidNYC for recommending the <a href="http://www.nutrabio.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Store_Code=NOS&amp;Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=25550">NutriBio Java Whey Isolate</a>, if you like it please contact NutriBio to let them know, hopefully we can get them to provide it in bulk.</p>
<p>This version differs from the original primarily in that it now uses <strong>Whey in place of Soy</strong> protein, as well as having further reduced calories. I have created several versions of the new whey based recipe, primarily with variance to the macro ratios and differing micro sources. This versions no longer uses the Trader Joe&#39;s Soy protein as a source for some of the micros, instead the missing micros have been replaced by adding new ingredients. There are earlier iterations of this recipe if you prefer to use the Trader Joe&#39;s Soy Protein. I have not tried the drops for the Molybdenum or Folate that are needed now that the TJ&#39;s Soy protein has been removed, if you have any experience with either product please share. <em>(Been using these drops for a while now without issue.)</em></p>
<p>This version is at 1600kcal and is set to a macro ratio of <strong>40/25/35</strong>. </p>

<p>The MSM sulfur has been removed from the recipe. The dietary sulfur totals have been updated showing the SAA (Sulfur-containing Amino Acids) content, which is coming from methionine and cysteine in the protein. </p>
<p>What I have been able to find indicates Soy Protein Isolate should contain 1.3g each of methionine/cysteine per 100g of protein. </p>
<p>Here is a <a href="http://discourse.soylent.me/t/sulfur-in-cysteine-and-methionine/10626/10">discussion concerning SAA content</a> on Discourse for those who may be interested.</p>

<p><em>v 1.1</em></p>
<p>I have made adjustments to the calories, dropping nearly 500, this recipe is now nearly down to 1800. I have also tweaked the Carb/Protein/Fat ratios to be close to a 40/20/40 for my personal use. The flour and oils now have been lowered, while the protein has been raised. </p>
<p>I am also expecting to remove the MSM Sulfur, from some of my reading it seems that the SAA content in some of the ingredients will likely cover the Sulfur needs, however I have not had a chance to calculate the current SAA&#39;s.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve started with mixing the Hacker School soylent to try, but wanted to make it into a complete recipe, and I also liked the look of QuidNYC&#39;s Superfood. This recipe is my attempt at a combination of the two. </p>
<p>All of the components can be sourced from Amazon except for the Trader Joe&#39;s Soy Protein. I kept this protein in the recipe as I liked how well fortified it was, if you do choose to go with something else more easily obtained please be sure to adjust for the reduced nutrients. </p>
<p>I highly recommend stopping by <a href="https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/quidnycs-superfood-for-him">QuidNYC&#39;s page</a> he has done an amazing job of explaining his process, and if you would like to see the original Hacker School recipe it can be found on <a href="http://www.cookingfor20.com/2013/06/18/hacker-school-soylent-recipe/">their blog,</a> or in a recipe from <a href="https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/2potatoes-hacker-school-not-modified">2potatoes.</a></p>
<p>I have only been making the Hacker School variety for a couple of days now, and will be getting the remaining ingredients to try this new hybrid recipe within the next week or two. I will post an update once I am able to try this out, fingers crossed.</p>
<p>I will say that so far I am happy with the flavor and overall experience of the Hacker School I am currently using, it just needed updated to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>This recipe would be for weight loss for me...hopefully. YMMV.</p>
<p>I welcome feedback, as I am new to DIY soylent. Please speak up if you see any glaring errors. :smile:</p>
