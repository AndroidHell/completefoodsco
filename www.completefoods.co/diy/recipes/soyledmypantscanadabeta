<p>-acquire a good probiotic to compliment soylent. </p>
<p>-get a larger scale - mixing this on my small scale is ridiculous!</p>
<p>-Adjust Protein/Carb/Fat balance to a little closer to 50 25 25 or alternative.  Do further macronutrient research.  See content below. </p>
<p>-Wanting to incorporate a new multivitamin that will potentially eliminate some of the additional items  Eliminate Green powder blend (though I kinda like it) and maybe even eliminate oats though the minor mix is fine. 
-Eventual goal is to eliminate odd and challenging ingredients.   Choline, K2 supplement, oat flour... a completely whole food approach would be amazing.   Vitamins ok for now. </p>
<p>-Cream of Tartar is expensive if not bought in bulk.   Also, not sure how it will affect digestion. We shall see.  If needed will have to source Potassium Citrate or find powdered spinach (something with a lot of potassium/vitamin A etc.  (Famous Foods).  Could even try various lentil powders.   Spinach is huge in Vitamin K, A and potassium.  Could be a great way to remove a few things.  (see cronometer.com or for spinach raw).  <a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/foods-spinach011000000000000000000.html">http://nutritiondata.self.com/foods-spinach011000000000000000000.html</a></p>
<p>-Get the definitive break down on Spirulina and Vitamin A content. Why do some report none and other TONS. </p>
<p>-Will want to taylor future mixes to include more super foods and nutropics such as lions mane etc.  </p>
<p>-Consider using soy lecithin granules in substitution for choline explore later to see what&#39;s replaced. Mimic Quid&#39;s fats as well - MCT etc.    </p>
<p>-Will want to switch to the Navitas naturals raw cacao review QuidNYC&#39;s cacao info again - to make up for Acrylamide content and nutritional differences.  Might want to add a couple more grams of protein to moderate in mean time. </p>
<p>======ALTERNATIVE MACRO/MICRO SOURCES======</p>
<p>-Egg powder is a strong substitute for choline bitartate  -  1on (28g) = 389 mg. 
<a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/dairy-and-egg-products/125/2">http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/dairy-and-egg-products/125/2</a></p>
<p>-Nutrional yeast a strong candidate for modification.   Lots of B vitamins.    Or marmite  .<a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/custom/1323565/2">http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/custom/1323565/2</a> Might upset the niacin balance again.  </p>
<p>-Molybdenum. Other significant dietary sources include green beans, eggs, sunflower seeds, wheat flour, lentils, cucumbers and cereal grain. Quids gets his from vitamins. </p>
<p>-Consider using soy lecithin granules in substitution for choline explore later to see what&#39;s replaced. Mimic Quid&#39;s fats as well - MCT etc.    </p>

<p>-H20 data from City of Vancouver.   Used Capilano source data though a more precise but likely minor data might include the evaluation of the other two water sources and a site specific adjustment, or maybe even an averaging of all totals.

<p>-Masa Harina nutritional info is based on QuidNYC&#39;s cheaper food value.  I don&#39;t have the exact info as it was purchased bulk at Famous Foods (Vancouver).  Going for a &quot;it&#39;s gotta be close to the same&quot; estimate.  Keeping in mind that the nutritional value of this compared to what i usual eat is OUTSTANDING, i&#39;m confident I&#39;ll be getting more of my basic needs met here that I wouldn&#39;t otherwise.</p>
<p>-Carb and calorie count.   Introducing oats was not my preference but I needed to to make up for a few things  - primarily molybdenum but looking at the increased carbs and calories I&#39;ll want to remove this and factor in additional nutritional sources. May not be necessary to keep it at all right now but will tinker some more.   Will want to eventually tinker with the carb/protein/fat ratios but feeling satisfied right now. </p>
<ul>
<li>Nutrient profiles:  Notes:</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the U.S. government&#39;s DRI standards. Assumes that calories are allocated as</p>
<p>50% carbohydrate
30% fat
20% protein</p>
<p>To change these figures, note that carbs have about 4cal/gram, protein has about 4cal/gram, and fat has about 9cal/gram.</p>
<p>So to hit a given number of calories, with given percentage of the calories coming from carbs, fat, and protein, use these formulas:</p>
<p>amount of carbs = (total calories <em> (% from carbs / 100)) / 4
amount of protein = (total calories </em> (% from protein / 100)) / 4
amount of fat = (total calories * (% from fat) / 100)) / 9</p>
<p>The DRI recommendation is that you get 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories. So say</p>
<p>amount of fiber = 14 * (total calories / 1,000)</p>
<p>The DRI sets no guidelines regarding sulfur intake, because it is always present in adequate amounts in an ordinary diet. The listed amount is Rob&#39;s recommendation.</p>
<p>The DRI sets no upper limit on magnesium intake, but sets an upper limit of 350mg for magnesium intake from supplements. Magnesium is easy to overdose on; be careful.</p>

<p>======MACRONUTRIENT RATIOS======</p>
<p>-&quot;There are 4 calories per gram of carb, 4 per gram of protein, and 9 per gram of fat.&quot;  QuidNYC</p>
<p>-Now that you know calories come from protein, fat and carbohydrates, and how many calories each of these macronutrients provides, you will want to know how much each macronutrient should contribute to your diet. The answer is commonly expressed in percentages and referred to as micronutrient ratios, or simply nutrient ratios.</p>
<p>Example: 30% protein, 15% fat, 55% carbohydrates
In order to obtain optimal health, and the slim body that comes with it, you need to eat healthy foods. But it&#39;s not enough to simply eat healthy foods; the foods must provide a healthy balance of all three macronutrients.</p>
<p>There is no one set of numbers that is best for everyone, and the percentages that are best for you can change with your circumstances. At different times your goal might be to lose body fat, gain muscle, or both.</p>
<p>Examples of Ratios</p>
<p>The USDA Food Guide recommendations, based on a diet of 2000 calories per day, include 91 grams of protein, 65 grams of fat, and 271 grams of carbohydrates. This equates to 18% of calories from protein, 29% from fat, and 53% from carbohydrates.</p>
<p>While one of the goals of the Food Guide is to reduce consumption of fat, many would consider 29% too high for optimal health. But perhaps it&#39;s a good compromise for the average American who might not be willing to reduce fat consumption further.</p>
<p>USDA: 18% protein, 29% fat, 53% carbohydrates
In his book Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle, author Tom Venuto recommends a baseline diet of 30% protein, 15-20% fat, and 50-55% carbohydrates. These percentages are referred to as &quot;baseline&quot; because they are only meant to be a starting point.</p>
<p>The book instructs you in how to modify the baseline percentages based on your body type and goals. And how, after measuring your initial results, to further refine them to meet the requirements of your particular body.</p>
<p>Burn the Fat: 30% protein, 15-20% fat, 50-55% carbohydrates
The percentage for protein is higher than the USDA recommendation because Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is based on the concept of eating properly and exercising to ensure that you do not lose muscle while losing fat. Losing muscle causes your metabolism to slow and weight loss to stop.</p>
<p>You will find that most diet plans recommend specific proportions of the three macronutrients. Keep in mind that any diet plan proposing extremely low proportions of any of the three macronutrients may be designed for quick weight loss and have little chance of long-term success. People often find that they tire of eating in such extremes and quit, rendering their diet a failure.</p>
<p>Converting the Percentages to Grams</p>
<p>Once you have determined the macronutrient ratios you will be using, it&#39;s easy to calculate how many grams of each macronutrient you should be eating. But first you have to calculate the total number of calories you will eat in a day as described in Calculating Daily Calorie Needs.</p>
<p>daily calories x percent protein / 4 calories per gram = grams protein
daily calories x percent fat / 9 calories per gram = grams fat
daily calories x percent carbs / 4 calories per gram = grams carbs
For example, if your daily calorie needs are 2000 calories and you choose proportions of 30% protein, 20% fat and 50% carbohydrates:</p>
<p>2000 x .30 / 4 = 150 grams protein
2000 x .20 / 9 = 44 grams fat
2000 x .50 / 4 = 250 grams carbs
This tells you how many grams of each macronutrient you should be eating to achieve the ratios you have chosen. Another way of looking at it is to calculate the ratios of what you are eating, and then make adjustments accordingly.</p>
<p>Calculating the Ratios of the Foods You Eat</p>
<p>Butter and oils contain only fat, and sugar and honey contain only carbohydrates. But foods comprised of a single macronutrient like these are the exception. Most foods consist of a combination of two or all three of the macronutrients.</p>
<p>To see the proportions of a food you eat, simply calculate the food with the Food Calculator. If a food doesn&#39;t appear in any of the food lists, you can enter the grams of protein, fat and carbohydrates with the Add Foods feature and then calculate it.</p>
<p>To see the proportions of a combination of different foods, calculate each of the foods and let the results accumulate. The results will indicate the percentage of protein, fat and carbohydrates for the total of the foods you calculate.</p>
<p>The formula used by the calculator is quite simple, and you can do the math by hand if you prefer:</p>
<p>(grams protein x 4) + (grams fat x 9) + (grams carbs x 4) = total calories
(grams protein x 4) / total calories = percentage of calories from protein
(grams fat x 9) / total calories = percentage of calories from fat
(grams carbs x 4) / total calories = percentage of calories from carbs</p>

Diet and Weight Loss Tutorial</p>
<p>======QUIDNYC TIPS======</p>
<p>-&quot;Taste:</p>
<p>With the addition of cocoa powder to the latest version of the mix (thanks, BrinDeezy!), the flavor profile has significantly improved (without the cocoa it is best described as &quot;neutral&quot;). With its high polyphenol and flavonoid content, cocoa powder is a superfood in its own right (see, e.g., <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/809158">http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/809158</a> ).</p>
<p>That said, the recipe could be made without cocoa if so desired (just be sure to adjust the macronutrients accordingly to compensate for what is taken out).</p>
<p>Note that I have selected a raw cacao powder in order to avoid potentially very high chronic exposures to acrylamide. Acrylamide content in roasted (i.e., any non-raw) cocoa powders can approach 1,000 ppb (this compares to 5-10 ppb in brewed coffee or several hundred ppb in instant coffee) -- which is a worrisome amount of a known carcinogen to be consuming on a regular basis. The acrylamide content of raw cacao is zero.</p>
<p>At the risk of making the recipe slightly less &quot;super&quot; (and if you&#39;re not persuaded about the risks posed by acrylamide), some may prefer to substitute Dutch process cocoa for the raw cacao (the flavor would be more &quot;chocolaty&quot;).</p>
<p>Note also that some people may prefer the flavor profile of the more fragrant Saigon cinnamon over the Ceylon variety (see my &quot;Female Blend&quot; recipe linked above for an example of this).&quot;</p>
