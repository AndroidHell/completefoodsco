<strong>Disclaimer:</strong><br>
This recipe was made specifically for my weight, gender, and activity level.  Women MUST adjust the mineral levels, and both sexes should use the Protein Analysis spreadsheet linked below to find their personal protein requirements.  You&#39;ll have to copy the recipe to your own profile and adjust the proteins yourself.  Any activity calculator can help you find your own calorie burn rate.  Remember: This is keto, so don&#39;t worry about calories too much.  Just hit your macro percentages, workout, and fast every now and then.  My <em>goal</em> with this recipe was to make a sugar free, ketogenic, vegetarian (pescatarian?), and personalized recipe.  The first two alone eliminated every DIY.soylent in the database.  I also wanted to avoid the extreme protein allotments in every other keto available.  I kept cost and number of ingredients as a huge consideration, but the research wouldn&#39;t allow it to be perfect.<br></p>
<hr>
<p><br>
<strong>Usage:</strong><br>
Step 1:  Don&#39;t eat breakfast.  Have some morning tea (Tbsp of butter if you want), and all vitamins and so forth.
  Should include: Rosea, multivitamin pill, D3, turmeric, black pepper.  It&#39;s important to keep the multivitamin pill separate from your meal due to mineral absorption rates.  Getting ALL of your minerals at the same time can completely stop the uptake of many of them as the body uses the same uptake pathways for multiple types of minerals.  <br></p></p>
<p>Step 2: Have this for lunch, and possibly dinner along with the calcium pill.  Also, see the <em>Fats</em> section for research on benefits to fasting (aka skipping breakfast).  Hemp can be very gritty, but I&#39;ve noticed that letting it sit for 15 minutes or adding more water, helps a lot.  <br></p></p>
<p>Step 3: Have a spinach salad every couple days.  This is my personal suggestion as it keeps me happy.  I get to chew on something and I get a lot of fiber and fats, with no need to cook, think or worry about protein.
<br><br>
<strong>Version 0.25</strong> 12/27/2016<br>
<strong>Recipe variations:</strong><br></p>
<p>1) Pea Protein only recipe:<br>
86g Pea Protein isolate &lt;---for me.  Use the Protein Analysis spreadsheet to find your ideal amount.<br>
600mL water.  Also, make sure to up the fiber.  Or eat a bunch of celery.<br></p>
<p>2) If you remove cacao then up the flour by 10g.<br></p>
<p>3) For a more savory recipe try this:<br>
Skip the sucralose and add some garlic (3-4 cloves of fresh stuff, NOT the powder...), 2 tsp paprika or chili powder. This also works well with the potato flavour of methionine.<br>
You can leave the cacao powder in for this version.  The cacao helps combat the dirt flavour of the hemp.<br>
<br></p>
<p>4)Vanilla extract can replace the cinnamon, but does little to combine with the cinnamon.  Try at 0.75 Tbsp per cup of liquid.<br></p>
<p>5) Stomach issues?: 57mL of MCT oil was too much for my gut to handle.  I was nauseous for 4 hours the first time I tried this recipe. The flavour was partially to blame though.  Try dropping MCT oil to around 25mL, and upping avocado oil by 40mL, and then work back up from there.<br>
You will also need to adjust the water.  In order to keep the recipe thin, I figure 0.5mL water per mL MCT Oil  and 2mL water per mL avocado oil.<br>
I tried to drop MCT Oil to 40mL and still had stomach issues.  Try 30mL next time.   12/27/2016<br></p></p>
<p>6) Spicy.  &#39;Cause, why the fuck not?  Make a savory variation and add some Frank&#39;s at 1.5-3 Tbsp per cup.  For the record, I don&#39;t recommend this, because heavy heat makes it harder to absorb nutrition.  So, just toss Franks on your spinach salad or drink it straight.<br></p>
<p><strong>Nutrition Information and thoughts:</strong><br>
<strong>-Carbs:</strong><br>
    You don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; this shit.  Going zero carb in a keto diet is extremely difficult.  You can go all meat and fat, but then you neglect some very important vegetables, which will lead to some serious vitamin deficiencies, colon blockage, and even cancers of various types.  (YOU NEED FIBER!)  Anyways... This DIY meal is different.  It gives you everything you need (including 30g of fiber) in two to four cups of liquid drink.  So, isn&#39;t this an opportunity to have a true zero-carb meal?  Sure.  There are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Isopure-Protein-Powder-Cookies-Pounds/dp/B0015R26V8?th=1">zero-carb whey isolates</a>, and the cacao powder is mostly carbs, so that can be changed.  About the greatest benefit I can think of to carbs at all is that they work into the body quicker than the rest of the stuff (MCT oil excluded), which gives you a quick boost while the ketones build up.  As long as you stay below that 20g threshold you&#39;ll stay in ketosis and get the carb boost now, while getting the fats boost, later.  That being said, <strong>AVOID THE SUGAR</strong>.  Sugar is the reason I started this whole thing to begin with, so don&#39;t let your carbs be sugar. Use a whole grain flour or cacao powder. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM">Dr. Lustig&#39;s video</a> on why sugar and particularly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceFyF9px20Y">fructose</a> is an actual poison similar to ethanol, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhzV-J1h0do">Peter Attia&#39;s presentation</a> that backs him up. I&#39;ll talk a bit on sucralose later.</p><br></p>
<p><strong>-Fats:</strong><br>
    I aimed for 0 trans fat, very little polyunsaturated fats (sorry canola &amp; flaxseed oil), and as close to 50:50 of what is left.<br>
    It should also be noted that polyunsaturated fats (your omegas) in high amounts are acids and will go rancid quicker than others.  They also are the source of some confusion and controversy.  See next heading.</p><br>
    Beef Tallow is perfect in this endeavor.  But setbacks were the price (1.16/oz on those without tons of additives), and melting point (95°F and above).  Likely, the melting point would make the drink solidify and difficult to drink.<br></p>
Coconut Powders do have a lot of fat in them, but the drying process removes a lot of the fats that were in them, along with the water, so it ends up being very carb heavy. 10/22/2016</p><br>
    I&#39;ve narrowed down the oils to Avocado oil (light almost non-existent taste), and MCT Oil (no flavour at all), which is pure saturated fats vs coconut milk, which is around 55% saturated fats and some extra carbs.  MCT Oil reportedly has an affect on the bowels, but it&#39;s been okay drinking it from the bottle, so we&#39;ll see. 11/21/2016  Whelp, it&#39;s definitely having a more immediate affect on my stomach.  I&#39;ll try dropping the next mix by 70% and see how it does.12/20/2016  Seems like the magic number for me personally is around 30-25mL.  I&#39;m leaving it at 57 in the recipe as that is the optimal ratio, so if you can handle it, then go with that. 12/27/2016 Further research suggests MCT Oil can&#39;t be stored in the body, so it is used <a href="http://eatingacademy.com/nutrition/what-i-actually-eat">immediately</a>.  Since I want to use MCT oil as energy and not as a filler I&#39;ll have to figure out how much is considered too much.  The problem is easily mitigated by splitting up the meal and even skipping breakfast, but the question still stands.  Also, fasting is good for you. --&gt;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27240637">[2]</a><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-intermittent-fasting-might-help-you-live-longer-healthier-life/">[3]</a>11/29/2016</p><br>
    I went with cold pressed (NOT expeller pressed) plant oils; one that was high in saturated fats (Coconut Milk) and one that was high in monounsaturated fats (Avocado Oil/Olive Oil).11/21/2016<br></p>

   <em>See notes below for more info on fats.</em></p><br></p>
<p><strong>-Omega-3s:</strong><br>
    Check the &quot;<strong>More notes on fats</strong>&quot; section below to see the mass of material on this stuff..  Also to see how stupid the FDA is even though it controls such an important part of your life.</p><br>
    I originally wanted to use cod liver oil, because I don&#39;t want this to be a pill popper recipe.  But it turns out the oils all have TONS of vitamin A in them and/or are REALLY expensive.  The multivitamins also have tons of Vit A in them, and I still want to be able to eat spinach salads now and then, so I had to go with soft gels. See below for more info on Vitamin A.</p><br>
    About the Omega-3 to Omega-6 ratio.  There&#39;s a lot of info below, but I&#39;ll say this.  It is extremely difficult to hit the proper ratio unless I use canola oil, but that also gives me 0.7 g of trans fats.  Canola oil is relatively safe if I can find a cold-pressed unaltered brand (they call it <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2015/04/13/ask-the-expert-concerns-about-canola-oil/">deodorizing</a>, which removes the taste and creates trans fats) on the cheap.</p><br>
 This recipe has a 4.2:1 ratio of O-6 to O-3. (I&#39;m proud of that one.) 11/28/2016</p><br></p>
<p><strong>-Protein:</strong><br>
    It comes down to Hemp and/or Pea.  I&#39;m building this for hemp while I have the 3 lb bag.  But Hemp really is missing quite a lot of stuff that needs to be added in as extra, which is cheap but inconvenient.  I&#39;m going to play around with combining pea and hemp, or just eventually switch to straight pea.  Pea is a more complete protein and cheaper (if sourced as an isolate), but I really like that hemp has plant fiber.  Easy peasy fiber.10/22/2016<br></p>
    Okay, I decided to mix Hemp and Pea together, because the daily requirement with hemp was also giving me toxic levels of multiple minerals.  So, the question that&#39;s left is: What&#39;s the proper methionine amount?  I&#39;m sure if we dug into all the individual amino acids we&#39;d arrive at the same question, but methionine came up while I was trying to figure out sulfur and I stumbled upon some interesting research.  <br></p>
    <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2198910/">This</a> article goes over a study that concluded Cysteine + Methionine should equal 14 mg/kg/day.  This is the WHO&#39;s current stance.  However, the author stated that the population size was too small and the more accurate number was probably 2.1 g/day for a 70 kg individual.  Further studies showed individuals not hitting a nitrogen balance until 3.0 g of methionine was consumed.  The biggest problem is that methionine (along with glutamic acid) is also heavily liked by cancer cells.  Don&#39;t worry too much about this.  If cancer cells like them then your body also likes them and will have a better chance of actually getting a hold of them.  Many cancer cells don&#39;t really communicate with your other cells very well. This leaves you at a slight advantage as long as you don&#39;t consume massive quantities, which is why this diet avoids the recommended amount of glutamic acid.  I measured the methionine based on Sulfur content.  This seems like the best compromise until we learn more about these proteins.11/22/2016<br></p>
    The protein showing in the keto worksheet should be more than the protein in the Protein Analysis sheet.  This is because of the digestibility of protein.  All undigested proteins exit through defecation and do not add to calories.<br></p>
    May need to switch to a zero carb whey isolate.  Pea and hemp are... less than desirable flavours. Pea tastes like psychedelic mushrooms, which tastes like chamomile tea.  Hemp tastes like dirt.  That is not an idiom.  It tastes like the last time I fell in the grass and accidentally ate some dirt. Also hemp is very gritty.  This diminishes a little by brand and if you let it sit for 15+ minutes. 12/20/2016  Further testing shows the seasonings really make a difference.  Still made need less flavour for more variety. 12/27/2016<br></p>

<p><strong>-<a href="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/fiber">Fiber</a>:</strong><br>
    Recommended UL is 38 g/day for men.  <br>
    No word on what the ratio should be.  Fiber is normally classified as soluble or insoluble fiber.  It turns out that this distinction doesn&#39;t tell us much about its impact on health.  Better terms are viscous or nonviscous and dietary or functional or isolated.<br></p>
    Hemp provides a large amount of cellulose, which is a dietary fiber.  However, it seems a source of <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/9#340">functional</a> fiber is still needed, preferably soluble.<br></p>
    A lot of sites recommend Acacia.  People with IBS also recommend it.  Apparently the gut bacteria likes it more.  But, it&#39;s not considered a functional fiber because it&#39;s a polysaccharide.<br></p>
List of some fibers:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>Soluble: Guar, Xantham, Acacia (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5384297_Gum_Arabic_establishes_prebiotic_functionality_in_healthy_human_volunteers_in_a_dose_dependent_manner">fermentable, good results, 10
g</a>), Locust Bean<br></li>
<li>Insoluble:Cellulose<br> </li>
<li>Functional Fibers:<br></li>
<li>Soluble: Psyllium (poor fermentation), <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fiber-Fibersol-Digestion-Resistant-Maltodextrin-Pre-Biotic/dp/B01IUA2YR8?th=1">Resistant dextrins</a> and <a href="http://www.fibersol.com/products/fibersol-2/">starches</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fiber-Fibersol-Digestion-Resistant-Maltodextrin-Pre-Biotic/dp/B01IUA2YR8?th=1">starches</a>, Yacon (expensive), inulin (poor prebiotic)<br></li>
<li>Insoluble: ?<br></p>
So, ultimately I&#39;ll be going with 10 g of acacia, according to the study linked above.11/28/2016<br></p>
I&#39;ll be experimenting with Xantham gum at 0.5% as a thickener(?), but I need to do a test run first. 11/21/2016<br></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>-Digestion Enzymes:</strong><br>
    Seems to be a bunch of back-and-forth out there.  The only doctor not also selling their own product said that by taking them, your body will eventually shut down the enzyme production system.  So, take a couple times a week, or never and make sure to get fiber from different sources.  There&#39;s plenty of fiber from multiple sources in this recipe.<br></p></p>
<p><strong>-<a href="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/nutrient-index">Minerals</a>:</strong><br>
    The <em>iron</em> was initially a concern, but it seems we lose about 8 mg of iron a day and absorb only 10% of what we consume.  If true, then we need to eat 80 mg a day.  I&#39;m going to stick low and get my blood tested in 6 months.  Last time I was checked, they said my iron was really high.  Not good for the heart. 10/22/2016<br></p>
    I like the <em>Celebrate multivitamin</em> because they don&#39;t have calcium.  Calcium needs to be taken separately from Zinc, Iron, and Magnesium as the intestinal uptake transporters fill up after just 800 mg of material.  Still wondering how they know this...  Anyway, take Calcium later or earlier in the day keep Magnesium below 500mg.<br></p>
    <em>Magnesium</em> is high from the hemp seeds.  Toxicity indicator is diarrhea, so should be easy to watch out for. :) 11/28/2016  Though, according to the <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/#h8">National Institute of Health</a>: &quot;Too much magnesium from food does not pose a health risk in healthy individuals because the kidneys eliminate excess amounts in the urine.&quot;  This means the UL of 350mg applies to supplemental Magnesium, which is at 100mg in this recipe.  Interestingly, the RDA for Magnasium is 420mg.12/13/2016<br></p>
    <em>Sulfur</em>:  There&#39;s quite a bit of confusion on sulfur content of a diet.  The human body contains 140 mg of Sulfur on average.  The RDA is 400 - 600 mg for an adult male, but you could easily take 2 g and not hit toxic levels.  But this still begs the question: Does our body need elemental sulfur or does it just use the sulfur in methionine and cysteine?  And in the case of the latter, how much do we need? There&#39;s a hefty discussion on it <a href="https://discourse.soylent.com/t/sulfur-in-cysteine-and-methionine/10626/19">here</a>. Bottom line: We don&#39;t really know.  Get methionine + cysteine levels to 2.5 g/day and see how it works.  If a problem arises I may need up the methionine (not preferred as methionine is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine">linked to cancer</a>) or add MSM at ~1300 mg/day.<br></p>
    <em>Pyridoxine</em> is another name for <em>vitamin B-6</em>. Its primary purposes are to help enzymes break down protein and carry the dismantled amino acids to the blood stream. Vitamin B-6 is essential to get the most from your protein intake.<br></p>
    <em>Vitamin A</em> toxicity should not be a worry unless you are getting 1) above 10,000 IU from animal sources, or 2) above 25,000 IU from non-animal sources over a long time period.  Preformed Vitamin A comes from animal sources and has a high absorbtion rate mixed with a low expulsion rate.  Other sources of Vitamin A give chemicals known as provitamin A carotenoids (α-Carotene, β-Carotene, β-Cryptoxanthin) and other carotenoids (Lycopene, Lutein, and Zeaxanthin).  Only the provitamin A carotenoids are converted into retinol in the body.
In this recipe the OptiNutrition pils offer 10,000 IUs of beta-carotene &quot;and other mixed carotenoids&quot;.  Assuming they&#39;re provitamin A we can convert this to <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/#h2">mcg RAE</a> by using: 1 IU beta-carotene from dietary supplements = 0.15 mcg RAE.  This gives us 1500 mcg RAE daily.  RDA for Vitamin A is 900 mcg RAE for adults over 19, and the <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/#h8">UL is 3000 mcg RAE</a> for adults over 19.  I changed the Daily Requirements of the nutrition profile to reflect a provitamin A ONLY set of sources from dietary supplements.  If you want to eat any high Vitamin A foods alongside this recipe, you should be fine as long as it isn&#39;t liver. 12/13/2016<br></p>
   A word on <em>Manganese</em> toxicity.  This recipe calls for quite a bit of hemp, which is supposed to be high in Manganese.  Although the amounts are probably overstated, it still begs the question of whether this is too much Manganese.  Well, it seems we just plain don&#39;t know jack about Manganese intravenous toxicity.  The <a href="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/minerals/manganese#toxicity">Linus Pauling Institute</a> is weary to give an Upper Limit.  &quot;There is presently no evidence that the consumption of a manganese-rich plant-based diet results in manganese toxicity.&quot;  The Food and Nutrition Board set 11 mg/day arbitrarily, as long term studies have not been done, and probably won&#39;t ever be done.  There is one study that gave patients 30 mg/day for 8 weeks and did not report any issues.  However, the study did not measure manganese blood serum levels as it wasn&#39;t actually studying manganese. 12/13/2016 <br></p>
    <em>Niacin</em> UL is set very low.  Some people may initially experience skin flushing at levels as low as 35 mg/day.  However, <a href="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/niacin#toxicity">liver toxicity</a> does not occur until 750 mg/day.<br></p></p>
<p><strong>-Sweetener:</strong><br>
  I figure 16 grams of sugar is a good start.  That&#39;s about 4 teaspoons.  Which is:<br>
    2 packets Stevia 0.156<br>
    1/16 tsp Stevia Powder extract, .1941<br>
    1/2 tsp liquid Stevia<br>
    4 tsp of Xylitol<br>
    1/80 tsp sucralose? .012<br></p>
    I hate Stevia.  Even the new, refined Stevia where they managed to take most of the bitter out is still really bitter to me.  It&#39;s super sweet for half a second and then bitter for 10 minutes.<br></p>
    Aspartame probably causes cancer.  Even though hundreds of studies (backed by Big Soda) say it&#39;s totally safe, slightly fewer than hundreds of other studies (not backed by Big Soda) seem to think it&#39;s not the best choice. So let&#39;s avoid that. Sucralose is pretty safe, isn&#39;t completely digested by the body, and is 600 times sweeter than sucrose.  Plus; no bitter aftertaste.<br></p></p>
<p><strong>-Acids:</strong><br>
    Ascorbic is Vit C and I like to take more than RDA.  Be careful with this.  Antioxidants can be too much of a good thing.  Anything that becomes a health craze is probably more about making someone money than caring for your health.  Side note: Eating ascorbic acid is almost exactly like eating a Shock Tart.  All this time I thought it was the sugar mixed with the tartness that I liked.  Turns out the tartness has a sweetness to it.<br></p>
    Malic is important to all protein synthesis.  I probably don&#39;t need this in all reality.  It&#39;d probably be more useful to get L-ornithinine or however you spell that.<br></p></p>

<p><strong>More notes on fats!:</strong><br>
From examine.com (I love examine.com.  Highly recommend checking them out.  They citation everything):<br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Omega 3 fatty acids in flax seed (as well as in Hemp Protein) are
found in the form of Alpha-Linoleic Acid (ALA). Not only is ALA not
sufficient to supplement on its own, but ALA has to be converted by
the body into a usable form, and the ratio of conversion from unusable
form to usable is rather poor, somewhere in the range of 5-15%.
Omega 3 supplements in the form of EPA and DHA are what the body tends
to use for many of the benefits associated with Fish Oil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-and-<br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For vegetarians and vegans, supplementing with DHA from algae can
&quot;markedly [enhance] the DHA status (of serum and platelets)&quot; and
&quot;[provide] for the formation of substantial EPA&quot;. Supplementation
of ALA and/or GLA is not enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-and-<br></p>
<p>Check out wikipedia&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-6_fatty_acid">Omega-6 page</a> for health worries about Omega-6s.  TLDR: Omega-6 allows for the production of inflammatory substances.  Under normal conditions this response allows bodily systems to be alerted to damaged cells.  With the introduction of heavy doses of any pro-inflammatory substance--in this case O-6--this inflammation system can go haywire (Google &quot;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=silent%20inflammation&amp;oq=silent%20inflammation">silent inflammation</a>&quot;) and has been linked to breast cancer in women.<br></p>
  The reason they recommend a 2:1 ratio is that O-3 reduces O-6&#39;s chance to convert into these substances by taking up the enzyme pathway.  So, it&#39;s a brute force method, which I personally don&#39;t like, but we aren&#39;t sure how much O-6 or O-3 you actually need, so it&#39;ll have to do for now. &quot;Closely related omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids act as competing substrates for the same enzymes.&quot;<br></p>
  I originally was obsessed with DHA and EPA vs ALA, but (after reading the wikipedia) it seems that, while getting at least 1 g of EPA/DHA combo is important, the 1:5 ratio can be satisfied with total O-3 to total O-6, as Lineolenic acid (O-3&#39;s most common form) takes up the same pathways that produce Arachidonic acid, which is the inflammation causing fatty acid in O-6.<br></p>
    Here&#39;s why...  The AI (acceptable intake) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid#Dietary_sources">~1.6 g.day for men</a> and/or 0.6-1.2% of calories.  That puts me at about 18.396 calories of O-3 or ~2.044 g.  However, it&#39;s not possible to separate ALA, DHA, and EPA to determine which we need more of due to EPA/DHA&#39;s potency(?). Easy answer is to take the previous paragraph, and run with that.<br></p>
QED<br></p>
<p>-and-<br></p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/SiteIndex/ucm108351.htm">FDA</a>:<br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>the available scientific data, as outlined in FDA&#39;s &quot;Interim
Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional
Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements&quot;, FDA is announcing a
qualified health claim for EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids. While this
research is not conclusive, the FDA intends to exercise its
enforcement discretion with respect to the following qualified health
claim:</p>
<p>&quot;Supportive but not conclusive research shows that consumption of EPA
and DHA omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart
disease. One serving of [name of food] provides [x] grams of EPA and
DHA omega-3 fatty acids. [See nutrition information for total fat,
saturated fat and cholesterol content.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in other words: 3 g is safe to consume because we said so.  That is some bullshit science politics right there.<br></p>

<p>Zinc citrate is approximately 34% zinc by weight. For a dose of 50mg elemental zinc, take 146 mg zinc citrate.
Zinc sulfate is approximately 22% zinc by weight. For a dose of 50mg elemental zinc, take 220 mg zinc sulfate.
Zinc gluconate is approximately 13% zinc by weight. For a dose of 50mg elemental zinc, take 385 mg zinc gluconate.
Zinc monomethionine is approximately 21% zinc by weight. For a dose of 50mg elemental zinc, take 238 mg zinc monomethionine.
Zinc should be supplemented daily.</p>
<p>Superloading zinc by taking up to 100mg zinc a day is confirmed to be safe in the short term (2-4 months), but because this dose is higher than the 40mg Tolerable Upper Limit (TUL) of zinc, prolonged superloading is not advised. </p>
<p>Most cheap multivitamins use zinc oxide, which doesn&#39;t take up well in the body.<br>
Another issue: Zinc’s intestinal uptake is hindered by other minerals, including Calcium, Magnesium, and Iron, since they all use the same transporter. If the transporter’s uptake limit (800mg) is exceeding between these four minerals, absorption rates will fall. Taking less than 800mg of these four minerals at the same time is fine.  Which means I will likely have to dose with zinc separately.  Which just gets added to the list for now.<br></p>
<p>Question:  How long does this transporter take to reset? Assume 8 hours.</p>
<p>Take Calcium separately and keep Magnesium below 500mg.</p>
