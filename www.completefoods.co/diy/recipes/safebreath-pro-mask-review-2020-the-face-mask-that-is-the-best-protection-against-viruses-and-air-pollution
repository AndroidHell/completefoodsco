They have no phone number; they refuse to acknowledge complaints until AFTER they&#39;ve taken your money; and there seems to be a problem with their so-called return policy and return address, which doesn&#39;t according to documentation, accept returns! So, after waiting for weeks to get your mask($), you&#39;re supposed to mail it back to an invalid address and not only get scammed out of all your money, but lose the merchandise, as well? There&#39;s a reason they don&#39;t do phone support! The reason gadgetsul is making money isn&#39;t because they&#39;re a good company; instead, it&#39;s because we&#39;re in the middle of a pandemic and people are afraid they won&#39;t get the masks they need because even with the most reputable companies, it can take forever to get what you need! Gadgetsul says they have a return policy, but because you can&#39;t get a hold of them, and they only communicate when they are ready, and only acknowledge the parts that they want to acknowledge, and they don&#39;t make the return policy clear -- you are screwed! Do NOT give gadgetsul your credit card information. Not even through PayPal!</p>

Buyer beware! I ordered one mask but they charged me for three! I realized this a few minutes after my order went through and sent several emails. They ignored my emails. They even thanked me for my &quot;faith&quot; in them. Then, right after my card cleared for three masks, they finally acknowledged my complaints. They told me it was too late to change my order. And they never offered to do a refund or return. Worst of all, they don&#39;t have a phone number. You might think that the error was mine, that I mistakenly ordered multiple masks. But no, it&#39;s much more sinister than that: A few weeks ago, California banned this type of mask -- masks with vents/valves because while they keep the wearer safe, they expose everyone around the wearer to unfiltered aerosolized particles. Now, the CDC is asking folks not to wear them, as well. It is my guess that gadgetsul, receiving a heads-up about the situation, simply decided to milk it for all it was worth by scamming buyers through charging them extra. After all, their masks will probably become illegal in other states, thus making their inventory worthless. They got me for over $200.00 U.S. currency. </p>
