Assumes that calories are allocated as\r\n\r\n50% carbohydrate  \r\n30% fat  \r\n20% protein  \r\n\r\nTo change these figures, note that carbs have about 4cal/gram, protein has about 4cal/gram, and fat has about 9cal/gram.\r\n\r\nSo to hit a given number of calories, with given percentage of the calories coming from carbs, fat, and protein, use these formulas:\r\n\r\namount of carbs = (total calories \\* (% from carbs / 100)) / 4  \r\namount of protein = (total calories \\* (% from protein / 100)) / 4  \r\namount of fat = (total calories \\* (% from fat) / 100)) / 9\r\n\r\nThe DRI recommendation is that you get 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories. So say\r\n\r\namount of fiber = 14 \\* (total calories / 1,000)\r\n\r\nThe DRI sets no guidelines regarding sulfur intake, because it is always present in adequate amounts in an ordinary diet. The listed amount is Rob's recommendation.\r\n\r\nThe DRI sets no upper limit on magnesium intake, but sets an upper limit of 350mg for magnesium intake from supplements. Magnesium is easy to overdose on; be careful.","description":"<p>Based on the U.S. government&#39;s DRI standards.
