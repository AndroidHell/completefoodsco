I&#39;ll get all of my vitamins and electrolytes, and still have almost 50 g of protein and 1200 calories left to eat the rest of the day :)</p>
<p><strong>I have salt listed twice in my ingredients. The first bit (1.2 g) goes in the soylent, and the second bit (3.7 g) goes on the food I eat throughout the day. I am a salt fiend, so I have no problem reaching my sodium goal, but I&#39;m putting it in the recipe so my numbers work out :j</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="lineage-inspiration-">Lineage / Inspiration:</h2>
<p>I was first inspired by the fabulous European recipe, <a href="https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/liquid-cake-v13-2">Liquid Cake v1.3</a>... But then I switched to a ketogenic diet, so I created my own version: <a href="https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/chocolate-keto-liquid-cake">Chocolate Keto Liquid Cake</a>. Then I moved back to the US, so I spent some time looking at the ingredients in <a href="https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/keto-chow-104-master">Keto Chow 1.0.4</a> and that&#39;s how I&#39;ve arrived at this recipe :) I did a bunch of testing, so if you&#39;re interested in the nitty-gritty of recipe adjustments, you can check out my <a href="https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/american-keto-experimental">American Keto Experimental Recipe</a> to see all the gruesome details :)</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="supplements-">Supplements:</h2>
<p>In the morning I take: </p>
<ul>
<li>1 2000 IU vitamin D pill</li>
<li>8 g (makes about 600 mL) of bouillon (For sodium without making my soylent too salty. Also it makes a nice morning drink since I&#39;m not a coffee fan.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the evening I take:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 multivitamin</li>
<li>1 vitamin D pills</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-to-">How to:</h2>
<p>Once you decide you like this recipe you can multiply the quantities and easily make more than one day at a time for the same amount of effort. I usually make some multiple of 5 days worth at a time. Weigh each powder and dump them all into the same tupperware container. Open the vitamin K capsule(s) and pour its/their powdered contents into the tupperware. (0.2 capsules / day * 5 days = 1 capsule / 5 days) Put the lid on, and shake vigorously (holding the lid shut just in case!) while rotating the container through different angles until the powders are all well mixed.</p>
<p>Although you could grind the multivitamin up and add it to your powders, it&#39;s a lot easier to just swallow a pill. Meanwhile, the vitamin D has liquid inside, so that would be rather a mess. Just take a vitamin D pill every morning, and a vitamin D + a multivitamin every evening and you&#39;ll be covered :) (I know that the amount of vitamin D in this recipe may seem excessive, but apparently <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/05/10/vitamin-d-recommended-dietary-allowance.aspx">when they calculated the RDA for vitamin D they misplaced a decimal</a>, and we&#39;re all supposed to be getting 10 times as much vitamin D as we&#39;d thought.)</p>
<p>The total powders for 1 morning weigh about 84 g. I take a shaker bottle, run a little bit of hot tap water into the bottom, and then put it on the scale and zero the scale. I spoon 84 g of powder into my shaker bottle and add the blender ball. Then I add some more warm water (you&#39;ll have to experiment to see how much you like), close it tightly, and shake it for about 30 seconds or so. I put it in the fridge overnight, because it tastes much better after it has sat for at least a couple of hours to let the powders thoroughly dissolve. Also, this is mostly whey and I detest warm milk :p I find that the soylent mixes well enough in the shaker cup that I don&#39;t need to use a blender for this recipe, though YMMV. </p>
<p>Make sure you shake it a bit before drinking, just in case it&#39;s settled a bit. You may prefer a different texture, so you can experiment with more or less xanthan gum and water. Worst comes to worst, the first few times you make it you may end up needing to add some extra water to thin it out prior to drinking.</p>

<h2 id="pro-tip-">Pro Tip:</h2>
<p>If you don&#39;t have a fridge at work I have two recommendations for you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy a <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/BlenderBottle-28-Ounce-Insulated-Sling-Black/dp/B004MPR052">neoprene blender bottle sleeve/sling</a> to help keep your soylent cold.</li>
<li>Buy some <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/Ice-Ball-Maker-Premium-Silicone/dp/B00CKH8ITQ">ice ball molds</a> and make ice balls. Mix your soylent with a little less water than you like, and pop an ice ball in the blender bottle right before you leave for work. </li>
</ol>
<p>Between the sleeve and the ice, your soylent should still be pretty chilly at lunch time :) </p>
<p>Please note that this beverage contains no preservatives, so in general it should be kept in the fridge and consumed within 3 days. Besides, it tastes like chocolate milk, and warm milk is pretty gross!</p>

Some research suggests that taking folic acid in doses of 800-1200 mcg might increase the risk of heart attack in people who have heart problems. Other research suggests that taking these high doses might also increase the risk of cancer such as lung or prostate cancer.\" http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-1017-folic%20acid.aspx?activeingredientid=1017&activeingredientname=folic%20acid\r\n\r\n\"Folic acid overdose is not known to have any deleterious effects on the human body. An overdose is also rare because the body may eventually excrete the high amounts or excess of folic acid. However, consumption of high doses (above 1,000 mcg) over a long period of time can result in some problems. Some of the symptoms of folic acid overdose are as follows: Diarrhea; Insomnia; Digestive problems (such as nausea or gas); Rash; Zinc deficiency; Numbness in the mouth or tongue; Fatigue; Inability to concentrate; Psychotic behavior; Bitter taste in the mouth; Irritability, excitability, or hyperactivity; Reduced appetite; Depression; Seizures; Allergic reactions like swelling on face, throat, lips or tongue.\r\n\r\nMoreover, high doses of folic acid can also mask a vitamin B12 deficiency. Folic acid from the supplement will treat the anemia caused by the vitamin B12 deficiency, however, the nerve damage associated with the deficiency will go undetected. An overdose of folic acid is also seen to inactivate the effect of anti-epilepsy medication. This means folic acid is indirectly harming the body, by not allowing the detection of another deficiency. High dose of folic acid is also feared to increase risks of heart attacks in people with heart diseases.\" http://www.buzzle.com/articles/folic-acid-overdose-symptoms.html","name":"mclaypool's keto for lunches 8/2016","description":"<p>my goal for lunch is 40 - 50 g protein and 200 - 400 calories (I usually also have a can of tuna salad)</p>\n<p>I want to get all my micronutrients taken care of during breakfast and lunch; anything I get during dinner is gravy :)</p>\n<p>includes updated calcium:magnesium ratio</p>\n<p>45 g carbs - 15 g fiber = 30 g net carbs :)</p>\n<p>U.S. government DRI, female 19-30, Sedentary, Non-Lactating</p>\n<p>3/29/2015 - Just confirmed that the previous recommendation for vitamin D was off by a factor of 10!!! <a href=\"http://www.newswise.com/articles/scientists-confirm-institute-of-medicine-recommendation-for-vitamin-d-intake-was-miscalculated-and-is-far-too-low\">http://www.newswise.com/articles/scientists-confirm-institute-of-medicine-recommendation-for-vitamin-d-intake-was-miscalculated-and-is-far-too-low</a></p>\n<p>10/30/2014</p>\n<p>1731    kcal Daily Calorie Intake</p>\n<p>25    g Carbohydrates (6%, 100 kcal)</p>\n<p>90    g Protein (21%, 360 kcal)</p>\n<p>141    g Fat (73%, 1271 kcal)</p>\n<p>based on <a href=\"http://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/\">http://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/</a></p>\n<p>Used &quot;sedentary&quot; activity level - If I exercise and burn more calories, I&#39;ll add fat to satiation.</p>\n<p>3/30/15 - set max sodium &amp; chloride to 5 g each.</p>\n<p>from <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_replenish_electrolytes.3F\">http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_replenish_electrolytes.3F</a>, I adjusted the sodium upwards a bit:\n5000 mg of sodium chloride (salt)\n= 1967 g sodium + 3033 g chloride\n1000 mg of potassium, in the form of potassium chloride or potassium sulfate\n300 mg of magnesium</p>\n<p>I changed the upper limit of folate from 1000 mg to 1100 mg since my recipe is a bit over and I&#39;m not really worried about such a small overdose...
