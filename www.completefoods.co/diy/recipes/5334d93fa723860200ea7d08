<p>I&#39;ve started this journey by mixing the <a href="http://www.cookingfor20.com/2013/06/18/hacker-school-soylent-recipe/">Hacker School</a> soylent to try, but decided that I wanted to make it into a complete recipe, and I also liked the look o​​f <a href="https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/quidnycs-superfood-for-him">QuidNYC&#39;s Superfood.</a> This recipe is my attempt at a combination of the two. </p>
<p>All of the components can be sourced from Amazon except for the Trader Joe&#39;s Soy P​​rotein. I kept this protein in the recipe as I liked how well fortified it was, if you do choose to go with something else more easily obtained please be sure to adjust for the reduced nutrients. </p>
<p>Please see below for progress updates and tips. The change log is at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>I welcome feedback, as I am new to DIY soylent. Please speak up if you see any glaring errors. :-)</p>

<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<hr>
<h4 id="weekly-monthly">Weekly/Monthly</h4>
<p>I typically prepare at least a weeks worth, but prefer to do more. When making changes to the recipe it is better to try it out for a couple of days before committing to a large production run. </p>
<p>I have found it quicker and easier to use the above airtight containers, rather than trying to scoop out of the original packaging. </p>
<ul>
<li>Start by setting out all of your ingredients, you will also need a scale, a lightweight bowl large enough to fit your bulkiest ingredient, and something to add your measured ingredients to for mixing. </li>
</ul>
<p>This recipe makes just shy of a full quart in dry ingredients. I prefer to use 2 quart resealable containers to do my mixing, they are cheap and reusable, I have also seen large ziplock bags used, but would rather have something reusable. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Originally I had tried adding a days dry ingredients to a mixing bowl and stirring until combined, but found this took to much time. Now I line up a weeks worth of the 2 quart plastic tubs and add a days worth of the dry ingredients, seal them, shake them, and pour them into the 1 quart jars for daily use. This has saved a lot of time during the bulk preparation. You could of course skip adding them to the jars, but I prefer this as it takes less space and I have found it more convenient. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Next, pour the first oil into the oil jar, tare (zero) your scale and add the second oil. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Finish up by storing the dry ingredients in the fridge or freezer, I also keep the oils in the fridge. Refrigeration may not be necessary, but I would rather err on the side of caution, and I don&#39;t need the fridge for muggle food anymore. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="daily">Daily</h4>
<p>I prepare my daily batch the night before. You can mix it on demand, but I have found that it can be a bit more gritty if consumed immediately, as well as being a thinner mixture. I much prefer this recipe cold and well incorporated. The added time also allows the Chia seeds to fully dissolve, which helps the texture and suspension of the mix. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>To start, add at least half of your water to the blender and turn it on low. Slowly pour in the dry mix, if you go too fast some clumps may stick to the side walls and you will need to scrape them into the liquid while blending. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Next, turn the blender to high and pour in the oils. Then add your remaining water. I typically let it run about two minutes total on high, including the time while adding the liquids. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Place the blender jug into the fridge to chill overnight. The batch should have stayed mixed through the night, I have not had any settling issues, but since it is still in the blender jug I will usually throw it back on high for a minute in the morning, though I don&#39;t actually think it is necessary. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep in mind that the Olive oil will freeze in the refrigerator, so it&#39;s best to take it out a little while before mixing the batch. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, enjoy a good, nutritious food throughout your day. </p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I am new to keto myself, so am still learning. I plan to continue adding to ​this keto section slowly over time as I learn more or find something I think may be of interest to others here. There are varying opinions on ketosis, and I am not trying to convince any here of what is best for them. I do believe though that while no single diet is appropriate for everyone, a ketogenic diet could be beneficial for many of us and should not be dismissed out of hand. I don&#39;t know yet if keto is even right for me, but based on my limited knowledge and experience with it I think that it may provide the improved health in my case.</p>
<p>I would recommend visiting the blog of Peter Attia, <a href="http://eatingacademy.com/start-here">The Eating Academy</a>. He has been practicing a ketogenic diet for most of the last few years as he has gained better control of his health and metabolic disorder. His blog is well written and his development has been well documented.</p>
<p>Another blog, by Joseph Arcita offers a <a href="http://josepharcita.blogspot.com/2011/03/guide-to-ketosis.html">Guide to Ketosis</a> that may help to answer many of your questions.</p>

<p><em>Keto v 1.0</em></p>
<p>I was on this keto recipe for a short time (about 3 weeks) and found that my energy level was good and I felt good overall. I personally had no issues with transitioning in and out of ketosis, but some may have trouble. I came off of the recipe due to family obligations that were going to make it difficult to continue at the time, not due to problems with the recipe or ketosis. I actually quite liked the time I was in ketosis and plan to take it up again soon. I am hesitant though because I am expecting my Soylent ship to come in fairly soon, and would like to be able to give it a fair shake without worry of carb content. I found the flavor of the recipe to be OK, but not yet where I would like it to be, it is a work in progress.</p>
<hr>
<h5 id="2014-2-9">2014-2-9</h5>
<p>####One month update</p>
<p>I have been living on this for a full month now. The first couple of weeks the recipe was a bit spotty as I didn&#39;t yet have all of the ingredients, but I had enough to get started. The last couple of weeks I have been using the full recipe. </p>
<p>So far I have been doing about 90% soylent overall, with most days being only soylent, and occasionally I will have a day with a social meal out. I do expect to have 1-3 traditional meals per week, so going forward soylent should remain about 90% of my diet. </p>
<p>I have liked this well enough to fully commit to it, I currently have a minimum of 3 months ingredients on hand, with a few that will last much longer. I do also have a large supply of Soylent coming, hopefully soon, but at this point I don&#39;t expect to abandon my home recipe to go exclusivity with the official version. I am hoping I like it well enough to keep it on hand as well to supplement my own supply when needed. I expect it will be easier to travel with, as they say it can be mixed on demand, whereas I prefer my mix to sit in the fridge overnight. </p>
<p>So far I am feeling fine, no complaints thankfully, but a few good points. I have noticed my energy being much steadier throughout the day, no more afternoon crashes. Sleep seems to be of a better quality, and getting up is not a problem. </p>
<p>I am not regularly hungry, I tend to have my soylent throughout the day. When I start to feel a bit peckish I will down a few ounces.  I no longer experience food cravings, but since I am getting a much more complete diet I guess I&#39;m not all that surprised. No more cravings, for me at least equals no more binging, which I&#39;m sure helps with weight loss and health overall. Not being hungry, and not having cravings, also means I am not missing food, and of that I am glad.</p>
<p>Improving my health was one of the driving forces behind starting this journey. I have a sedentary job, and don&#39;t have a daily exercise routine, but I do try and stay active through some group activities and sports. Weight has been an issue for me since adolescence, although I stay active enough that I think my overall health is better than my weight suggests. I am down 14 pounds in my first month on soylent, so the trend is going in the right direction. </p>

<p>Those of you wishing to weigh your oil may like to know that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Olive Oil has a density of 0.92 g/ml;</p>
</li>
<li><p>MCT Oil has a density of 0.93-0.96 g/ml;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So for this recipe you would need 20 grams of Olive Oil, and 20 grams of MCT Oil.</p>
<p>Also, while I am not myself vegan, I believe this recipe may be. Please let me know if you see that it is not and I will remove the tag, or update the offending ingredient if feasible.</p>
<p>I will say that this is my third day using the Hacker School soylent, and so far I am enjoying it. I am looking forward to the official shipment of Soylent to come and am curious to see if I will continue down the DIY path or go with the easy order. One of my goals in this is the simplicity.</p>

<p><em>v ​2.4​</em></p>
<p>​Latest recipe was changed to remove the masa in favor of oat flour. I have not yet tried the new brew, but thought it would be good to have available.​ The factory Soylent uses oats and many have complained of gastric issues. I want to have a chance to try it oats for myself while waiting on my shipment of Soylent.</p>

<p>This recipe is no longer vegan, for a vegan version please see <a href="https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/kennufs-hybrid-v13">Kennufs&#39; Hybrid v1.3</a> <strong>1800kcal @ 40/20/40</strong>. The new <a href="http://www.nutrabio.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Store_Code=NOS&amp;Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=25550">Java Whey from NutriBio</a> has a nice flavor and I think enhances the recipe.</p>
<p>Much thanks to QuidNYC for recommending the <a href="http://www.nutrabio.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Store_Code=NOS&amp;Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=25550">NutriBio Java Whey Isolate</a>, if you like it please contact NutriBio to let them know, hopefully we can get them to provide it in bulk.</p>

<p><em>v 1.3</em></p>
<p>The flaxseed meal was changed to whole seed, and the Lecithin was changed to a powdered form. Be sure to grind the flaxseed first or use a blender, whole flaxseed is not digested. </p>
<p>The Amazon links have been updated, as well as the pricing, a few of the ingredient brands have changed. All Amazon products should be eligible for free shipping if you are a prime member, pricing for the Subscribe &amp; Save items reflect the discount. </p>

<h5 id="2014-1-30">2014-1-30</h5>
<p><em>v 1.2</em></p>
<p>The MSM sulfur has been removed from the recipe. The dietary sulfur totals have been updated showing the SAA (Sulfur-containing Amino Acids) content, which is coming from methionine and cysteine in the protein. </p>
<p>What I have been able to find indicates Soy Protein Isolate should contain 1.3g each of methionine/cysteine per 100g of protein. </p>
<p>Here is a <a href="http://discourse.soylent.me/t/sulfur-in-cysteine-and-methionine/10626/10">discussion concerning SAA content</a> on Discourse for those who may be interested.</p>

<h5 id="2014-1-14">2014-1-14</h5>
<p><em>v 1.1</em></p>
<p>I have made adjustments to the calories, dropping nearly 500, this recipe is now nearly down to 1800. I have also tweaked the Carb/Protein/Fat ratios to be close to a 40/20/40 for my personal use. The flour and oils now have been lowered, while the protein has been raised. </p>
<p>I am also expecting to remove the MSM Sulfur, from some of my reading it seems that the SAA content in some of the ingredients will likely cover the Sulfur needs, however I have not had a chance to calculate the current SAA&#39;s.</p>

<h5 id="2014-1-10">2014-1-10</h5>
<p><em>v 1.0</em></p>
<p>I&#39;ve started with mixing the Hacker School soylent to try, but wanted to make it into a complete recipe, and I also liked the look of QuidNYC&#39;s Superfood. This recipe is my attempt at a combination of the two. </p>
<p>All of the components can be sourced from Amazon except for the Trader Joe&#39;s Soy Protein. I kept this protein in the recipe as I liked how well fortified it was, if you do choose to go with something else more easily obtained please be sure to adjust for the reduced nutrients. </p>
<p>I highly recommend stopping by <a href="https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/quidnycs-superfood-for-him">QuidNYC&#39;s page</a> he has done an amazing job of explaining his process, and if you would like to see the original Hacker School recipe it can be found on <a href="http://www.cookingfor20.com/2013/06/18/hacker-school-soylent-recipe/">their blog,</a> or in a recipe from <a href="https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/2potatoes-hacker-school-not-modified">2potatoes.</a></p>
<p>I have only been making the Hacker School variety for a couple of days now, and will be getting the remaining ingredients to try this new hybrid recipe within the next week or two. I will post an update once I am able to try this out, fingers crossed.</p>
<p>I will say that so far I am happy with the flavor and overall experience of the Hacker School I am currently using, it just needed updated to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>This recipe would be for weight loss for me...hopefully. YMMV.</p>
<p>I welcome feedback, as I am new to DIY soylent. Please speak up if you see any glaring errors. :smile:</p>

The ratio of carbs / protein / fat has been modified to reflect a lower carb, higher protein balance suitable for healthy weight loss in my individual case; you should likewise adjust to fit your own dietary needs.\r\n\r\n2.  Dietary fiber intake is based on the IOM recommendation of 14g / 1,000kcal total energy.\r\n\r\n3.  The targets for folate, phosphorous, and iodine are set to the IOM's estimated average requirements (rather than the DRI).  The max level for Vitamin B6 is set to the IOM's no-observed-adverse-effect level.\r\n\r\n4.  The data used to establish the IOM's AI for potassium are actually rather weak.  After reviewing the limited set of studies they considered, I see no compelling evidence favoring potassium intake in excess of 2.7g per day -- particularly in a dietary setting where sodium intake is tightly controlled (as with soylent).\r\n\r\n5.  The target ratio of ω-6 to ω-3 PUFA is between 2.3:1 and 1:1 (the standard American diet tends to be much higher). In addition, the ω-6 DRI is significantly reduced based on adequate ω-3 intake. For reference, studies have shown that ω-6 deficiencies are eliminated by 1-2% of calories as LA if the diet has no ω-3 (http://pmid.us/20102846), and by just 0.3% of calories as LA if the diet has over 1% ω-3 (http://pmid.us/14559071). Thus, a little ω-3 in the diet reduces the requirement for ω-6. The upper boundary is based on 10% of total energy from PUFA in all forms, which serves to limit the potential for oxidative stress from excessive PUFA intake (which remains a concern even when taken in carefully protected forms near the ideal ratio of ω-6 to ω-3).\r\n\r\n6.
