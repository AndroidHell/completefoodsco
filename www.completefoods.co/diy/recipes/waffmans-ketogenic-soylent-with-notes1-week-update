protein and mix. Add some cinnamon and stevia if needed for the taste. I dont like having the fiber in there due to the extra thickness it adds. The salt just ruins the taste. For the fibre and salt i just eat it with water quickly. Switching to coles linseed meal next buy for mixability Have used ketostix and am in a light purple state first thing in the morning. Have lost 4 kgs in first week, assuming its mostly water weight and lack of food in stomache. Have body fat% scales coming to track my lean mass over the next 2 weeks. Have put the recipe down to approx 1500cals to push the weight loss by cutting the olive oil and and some more peanut oil to reach omega 6&#39;s. Have decided to cut weight training and substitute it with cardio, even if it results in loss of muscle mass to fit into a suit in 3 weeks time.</p>
<p>This recipe starts with subliminal&#39;s complete micro base (ie, first 7 ingredients give the micro base), with the macros i&#39;ve chosen as justified below. </p>
<p>1) Why Soylent?</p>
<p>My diet has been rubbish lately, consisting largely of refined carbs and sugars (Man they&#39;re so tasty). I used to never eat breakfast and have tried eating plans such as intermittent fasting in the past, so i&#39;m no stranger to feeling hungry. The main reason i chose to do it is to be able to completely control what i put in my body, based on research i&#39;ve done into ideal nutrient profiles. Also the ease of having shakes instead of cooking! The cheap cost isn&#39;t a main reason but a perk.</p>
<p>2) Why keto?</p>
<p>For me, this is based on Charles Poliquin&#39;s philosopy that since i have a large subscap skinfold my body isn&#39;t equipped to deal with carbs. This is supported by the observation of previous diets i&#39;ve tried, where i&#39;ve seen the best results with limited carbs. It just works FOR ME, it may not work for you. I also like the fact it keeps you in line, having a large cheat meal will most likely throw you out of ketosis and take a few days to get back in. This keeps me focused and less likely to break the diet. </p>
<p>3) Proteins</p>
<p>I&#39;ve chosen WPI and Micellar Casein as my protein sources from Bulk Nutrients. Have been using proteins from BN for ages, very happy with their service and products. I like taking the casein first thing in the morning, as it is a more slow release protein, as well as just before bed. The WPI i snack on throughout the day, with a 60g serve after weightlifting. These are completely interchangeable for any other types/flavours of protein as long as the 150g is met each day.</p>
<p>4) Fats</p>
<p>This is where i see the biggest variation between recipes, with lots of peanut oil and canola oil being used. The aim of my fat profile was to provide an omega 3 to 6 ratio of close to 1:2. I chose olive oil as the main oil as i believe it one of the healthier oils based on the research i&#39;ve done, as well as having some omega 6&#39;s, with the peanut oil to make the target omega 6. The omega 3&#39;s have come from two sources, the flaxseeds (ALA) and fish oils (EPA/DHA), to give some variety. This ratio can be easily modified to suit individuals needs by adding or removing fish oil pills.</p>
<p>5) Carbs/Carb Cravings</p>
<p>I&#39;ve added carbs to try and hit around 30g, which i feel is a good amount based on what i&#39;ve seen. Changing the amount of drinking chocolate is an easy way to change this. For the carb cravings i drink zero sugar cola (caffeine free in the evenings). </p>
<p>6) But bro, will i lose my lifting gainzZz?</p>
<p>Woah, slow down brohan, no one said anything about losing gains. This section is mainly added from a weightlifting perspective, if you, my brococola are treating the soylent as a cutting phase. There are some extra things i add pre/post workout to assist with my body composition (maintaining lean mass despite the caloric deficit). I plan to maintain my muscle mass by weight training 4 times a week. Pre workout i have a serve of bulk nutrients preworkout 101 for the creatine, Cit Mal, BA and Stimulant effect (which i admit could use some work), to help my focus in the gym. Post workout i like to take 10g of glutamine, a couple of mag pills, some vitamin C and of course...BROTEIN!!. Make sure i take 5g of creatine total each day. </p>
<p>7) My thoughts since starting soylent, Psychological/Physiological/Social impacts.</p>
<p>Well i&#39;m one week in now, getting towards my 3 week goal which is rewarding. Am starting to feel hungry at times, is strange how it comes and goes. Smelling something yum like pizza or deep fried food definitely gets the stomach going. During the first week i&#39;ve had headaches intermittently, guessing its my body adjusting to things. Have been sleeping quite deeply, no noticeable change. Bowel movements fluctuate greatly, which has surprised me as my dietary intake has been the same. Will go from legendary clean pinches to complete liquid in no time. It has a large social impact, haven&#39;t been out for a meal/have cancelled plans with friends, but i&#39;m happy to sacrifice the 3 weeks to get in better shape and see the full effects of soylent. Still staying strong, feel i&#39;ve got this next week in me easy.</p>
