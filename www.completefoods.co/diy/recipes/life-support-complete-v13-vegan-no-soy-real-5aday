expensive and complicated compared to some of the other recipes but I don&#39;t think that getting all of my carbs from refined white sugar and flour is a very good idea - even if it does technically meet the RDA.</p>
<p>This is a genuinely high quality nutritious meal replacement. Requires a bit of effort to get set up but well worth it for the freedom it gives! Having a goto soylent that one can use safely 40% or more of the time to fill hunger gaps would be a really valuable tool.</p>
<p>Not strictly Soylent as it includes a little real food, but I am going to try and live on this stuff for 30 days as I need a better way to provide nutrition for myself.</p>
<p>This is an attempt to address the potential problems of living solely on powders. Bananas &amp; avocados can be picked up once a week, blackcurrants freeze and beetroot keeps for a while in the dark so not a huge strain on the kitchen either. Will tweak the list so everything other than veggies comes from Bulk Powders - Good quality and service, with some great moneysaving offers (and no I&#39;m not an affiliate I just spend my money there).</p>
<p>Profile is 40/30/30 protein, carbs &amp; fat. This may suit you if you are like me; Happy with your weight, not particularly active, need your brain for work, male aged 30 - 50, don&#39;t want to get old too quickly.</p>
<p>To account for exercise sessions or a more active lifestyle, add more Waxy Maize Starch. 30g is just over 100 calories.</p>
<p><strong>27/10/2015:</strong> The recipe finally looks pretty good and having ordered all the stuff and next week will start a 14 day stretch. Following that I am going to try for 10 days the Keto version I&quot;m also working on (1500 calories, 50g carbs)</p>
<p>Got 24% off at Bulk Powders last night by waiting for the right day in their offer cycle. This brought the cost down to approx £5/day.</p>
<p><strong>28/10/2015:</strong> A large box arrived here this morning. I unpacked and made a 1/4 day serving to try it out.</p>
<p>Was very surprised at just how good it tastes! I blended it up with a banana which made it a little too sweet for my taste but maybe that&#39;s something i&#39;ll get used to as it doesn&#39;t actually contain any sucrose.</p>
<p>I have had many supplement shakes, but nothing which actually pretends to be complete nutrition.This stuff is different, after 5 minutes I feel very satisfied and my mind feels sharp. This feels like it really could replace food and that thought is scary because it challenges my view of the world, and now I can&#39;t stop thinking about french fries and mayonnaise.....</p>
<p>But this is a good sign, after all it&#39;s exactly what we are trying to achieve with Soylent blends. Looking good so far but the taste whilst not unpleasant is quite strong and is going to get boring quite quickly. </p>
<p><strong>v1.1: Having checked out some other recipes, v1.1 includes mostly brown rice protein, and levels of hemp and pea have been dropped back.</strong></p>
<p>I had another shake 4 hours later. It&#39;s now mid afternoon, I feel good with strong concentration and no bloated feeling at all. Like a racing snake...</p>
<p>Had another serving for dinner along with a light fatty meal of sausages and cabbage.</p>
<p><strong>29/10/2015:</strong> Woke up this morning and finished up yesterdays batch. I feel good, a little empty but not hungry. I have both energy and concentration.</p>
<p>Made another serving for the next 24 hours and picked up an avocado from the shop. Does not taste good with an avocado alone. Maybe a dash of soy sauce would help here. Feel free to replace the avocado with something else fatty like maybe coconut flesh or powder.</p>
<p><strong>02/11/2015:</strong> I have cooked 3 meals in the last 6 days and otherwise had shakes in 500 calorie portions every 4-5 hours. I feel calm, relaxed, concentrated. Not full, but not hungry. Adding real fruit and vegetables really helps, I feel like this could be sustained for quite a while. Looks like I will do the whole 30 days</p>
<p><strong>05/11/2015:</strong> Day 8. Have only eaten twice in the last 3 days, otherwise just living on this stuff. </p>
<p><strong>v1.2: Tweaked ratio of proteins to lower cost. Added iodine &amp; B vitamin supplements</strong></p>
<p>This mix currently makes for just about 350g of powder per day. I split this up into 87g portions of 500 calories each, blended with 250ml water plus a one of the 5 a day. Its really is very palatable with a banana, delicious, nutritious and easy enough to replicate.</p>
<p>For me part of this experiment was to tackle some the issues that I have with actually feeding myself adequately. Now that I am getting my 2000 calories per day, even if it&#39;s only 90% of the time that is still a big improvement and I am really starting to feel good. It&#39;s quite possible that I have never had access to this level of nutrition before so some improvements in my health are to be expected.</p>
<p><strong>09/11/2015:</strong> Day 12. What can I say. I feel good. I don&#39;t miss food at all, and could get quite used to having stable energy all of the time. I have not cooked in over a week, the kitchen is so much easier to keep clean now.</p>
<p><strong>13/11/2015:</strong> Day 16. Due to the new levels of nutrition my mental health has reached a stability that I am not used to. This got me researching the specific supplements which aid cognitive function.</p>
<p><strong>v1.3: Tweaked levels of carbs, reducing the use of refined powders a little. Added spirulina to enhance the amino acid profile. Turmeric, glutamine &amp; DMAE added to enhance brain function, specifically to lift mood.</strong></p>
<p><strong>14/11/2015:</strong> Day 17. I have found it most convenient to mix up 3 days at a time. This makes almost exactly 1 kilo and is a convenient quantity to mix and store. I have some tall IKEA clip top jars which are perfect in terms of size and the clear glass means you can tell when it has all mixed in together as the colour becomes consistent throughout.</p>
<p>I do miss food, but it seems that my body does not.</p>
<p><strong>18/11/2015: Day 21.</strong> Wooo, 3 weeks!  I haven&#39;t really missed food the last few days at all. My body fat has been steadily decreasing and I have more energy, my mood is much better than when I started this programme. What can I say, it seems to be working. No cracking of the lips, blocked nose or anything. Not even any flatulence. I have yet to find the catch with eating like this. Preparation is pretty simple; 30 minutes every 3 days plus the time it takes to make a shake. This is exactly what I have been looking for.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now off to do a 10 day meditation retreat with a load of this powder. Because I will be physically inactive I am having a go at carb cycling; Day 1 40% carbs, Day 2 20% carbs, Day 3 7% carbs. The calorie deficit is made up with protein mostly on day 2, but on day 3 the deficit is huge so fat is used here. The aim of this is to reduce body fat and get the body used to burning glycogen for fuel.</p>

<p>28/10/2015: A large box arrived here this morning. I unpacked and made a 1/4 day serving to try it out.</p>
<p>Was very surprised at just how good it tastes! I blended it up with a banana which made it a little too sweet for my taste but maybe that&#39;s something i&#39;ll get used to as it doesn&#39;t actually contain any sucrose.</p>
<p>I have had many supplement shakes, but nothing which actually pretends to be complete nutrition.This stuff is different, after 5 minutes I feel very satisfied and my mind feels sharp.

<p>The taste whilst not unpleasant is quite strong and is going to get boring quite quickly. Having checked out some other recipes, v1.1 includes mostly brown rice protein, and levels of hemp and pea have been dropped back.</p>
<p>I had another shake 4 hours later. It&#39;s now mid afternoon, I feel good with strong concentration and no bloated feeling at all. Like a racing snake...</p>
<p>Had another serving for dinner along with a light fatty meal of sausages and cabbage.</p>
<p>28/10/2015: Woke up this morning and finished up yesterdays batch. I feel good, a little empty but not hungry. I have both energy and concentration.</p>
<p>Made another serving for the next 24 hours and picked up an avocado from the shop. Does not taste good with an avocado alone. Maybe a dash of soy sauce would help here. Feel free to replace the avocado with something else fatty like maybe coconut flesh or powder.</p>
