a serious business. There are a thousand and one products out there that are intended to help you look more appealing and slow signs of aging. But, as we know, many such products fail to deliver what they promise. In other words, they end up being a waste of money.XYZ Smart Collagen CreamNumerous ineffective skincare products out there might make you wonder whether XYZ Smart Collagen Cream is yet another one. If that’s the case, we understand how you feel. You have made a great decision to first learn more about the cream before buying. Read on to find out if it will make any sense at all to get it.</p>
<center><a href="https://rushyouroffer.today/buy/xyz-smart/" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://www.goldenhealthyreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/XYZ-Smart-Collagen-2.png" width="750" height="450"></a></center>

<p><strong>What is XYZ Smart Collagen Cream?</strong></p>
<p>Described as the “collagen cream that stops the clock,” XYZ Smart Collagen Cream is a relatively new product that promises to do wonder to your skin and reduce signs of aging. It relies on the power of nature to help you have a much younger appearance, according to its manufacturer. The product comes with a promise of production of high quality collagen to help remove signs of aging from your skin. It might be the perfect one for you if you have had it rough with products containing harsh chemicals.</p>
<p>Bauer Nutrition XYZ Smart Collagen Cream includes a potent plant-based formula. This, according to its maker, helps you to look “7.5 years younger.” Now, that’s something.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits associated with XYZ Smart includes:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Improved skin elasticity</li>
<li>Reduction of fine lines and wrinkles</li>
<li>Firmer, smoother skin Improvement of skin texture</li>
<li>Lifting of sagging skin</li>
<li>Reduction of size and depth of stretch marks</li>
</ol>
<p>XYZ Smart Collagen Cream is clinically proven to deliver these benefits as well, according to the company making it. In other words, its efficacy is not simply based on estimation or a guess. Collagen is a special type of protein. You are going to find it crucial if you desire to have or maintain a youthful and healthy appearance. The problem is that the production of this essential substance drops with age. This is what contributes to signs of aging, such as wrinkles and fine lines. It is estimated that, by the age of 35, levels can drop to as low as 50 percent of the peak levels.</p>
<center><a href="https://rushyouroffer.today/buy/xyz-smart/" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://www.goldenhealthyreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/XYZ-Smart-Collagen-re.png" width="750" height="450"></a></center>

<p>Not only does production drop; the quality of the protein that is produced also reduces. This makes it vital to find a way of making up for this loss with high-quality collagen to keep visible aging signs at bay.XYZ Smart Collagen Cream aims to help with the replenishment of collagen. The plant extracts it contains are intended to increase the synthesis of the protein. At the same time, they aim to control the breakdown of vital skin material.</p>
<p>You essentially have in this cream one that targets striking a balance between production and breakdown of collagen. This is the mechanism by which firm, smooth skin is ensured in younger individuals. You can easily get a product for fighting skin aging, as we noted earlier. The real issue is getting what works. If you have tried creams that didn’t work in the past, you might wonder what else XYZ Smart Collagen Cream brings to the table.</p>
<p>Skin products for fighting effects of aging usually aim at improving the production of collagen for obvious reasons. They often do this through reliance on transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-?) and its substitutes. There’s no question on the ability of TGF-? to improve collagen production – it can actually over-do this. The multifunctional cytokines can cause the synthesis of the important tissue protein to spiral out of control.</p>
<p>TGF-? stimulates fibroblasts, cells that are responsible for collagen synthesis. But that of itself isn’t enough to cause excess production. The growth factor is also believed to cause immune cells to release leukotrienes, which are what leads to even greater collagen synthesis. Excess levels disrupt the balance between collagen and elastin levels in your skin. This can cause your skin to lose elasticity and appear limp.</p>
<p>Bauer Nutrition XYZ Smart Collagen Cream, in its own case, boasts what its maker calls “Smart Collagen Management.” What this means is that it just doesn’t focus only on increasing collagen production. It aims more at maintaining a balance between synthesis and breakdown. The plant extracts this product contains help to increase collagen production by stimulating fibroblasts. But it differs from other products due to how this is a controlled process. The formula also inhibits the effect of leukotrienes on production.</p>
<p>This improves the chances of ending up with high-quality collagen that can indeed be beneficial for dealing with signs of aging on the skin. The protein that XYZ Smart Collagen Cream produces supposedly integrates into the existing collagen network of the skin more easily.</p>
<p><strong>The Ingredients Of XYZ Smart Collagen Cream</strong></p>
<p>The XYZ Smart Collagen Cream formula contains natural ingredients said to have been extracted from sustainably-grown, organic plants. According to the manufacturers, these are cold-pressed to protect their active constituents.</p>
<p>The two main active components in the cream are obtained from Bulbine frutescens, a plant native to South Africa. They are specifically extracted from the leaf sap of this plant. The compounds in question are:</p>
<p>APM is mainly responsible for the ability of XYZ Smart Collagen Cream to increase collagen production. It stimulates fibroblasts to improve synthesis. This helps to make your skin look youthful and healthy.</p>

<p>In its own case, knipholone is useful for guarding against the breakdown of collagen. It is a selective inhibitor of leukotriene metabolism and helps to prevent production from going wild.</p>
<p>It is the combined effects of these compounds that help to balance production and breakdown of the structural protein. This is the much talked about “Smart Collagen Management.”</p>
<p>Another thing that may appeal to you about XYZ Smart Collagen Cream is that it has been clinically shown to help indeed, at least according to its maker. The company says the cream was tested on 21 women in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The subjects fell in the age range 45 to 65.</p>
<p>The women in the study applied this cream to their face and neck two times per day for a period of 84 days. A qualified dermatologist was said to have carried out an “objective assessment” on the subjects at the beginning of the trial, halfway into the study, and at the end.</p>
<p>Noticeable results were reported at both the 42-day and 84-day marks. Women treated with XYZ Smart Collagen Cream supposedly looked 7.5 years younger than their real age, based on the third-party evaluation, at the end of the study.</p>
<p><strong>Is XYZ Smart Collagen Cream Worth Buying?</strong></p>
<p>This cream is a relatively new one. Yes, its manufacturer makes it sound like it’s the real deal. But many of us know better than to take words of companies making beauty products hook, line and sinker.</p>

<p>Being somewhat new, Bauer Nutrition XYZ Smart Collagen Cream doesn’t seem to have many reviews. The ones that we did manage to come across, however, shows this is a product you can consider checking out. And, if you ask for our opinion, we can say this looks like a product that can help slow signs of aging, such as fine lines and wrinkles. The main active ingredients have been shown in research to be potentially helpful. There is also a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study to back the efficacy.</p>
