<p>Be warned, if you ask &quot;how do I mix this?!&quot; I&#39;m going to reply: &quot;step 1 is you need to contact a custom nutrient formulator and have them make you 500kg of a vitamin/mineral pre-mix, be warned that this much will make 70 years worth for 1 person and cost US$25,000 to 30,000 - I&#39;m going to guess that instead, you&#39;ll want to use the recipe for Keto Chow 1.5&quot;</p>
<p>Results from my first year doing Keto: <a href="https://www.ketochow.xyz/2015/10/1-year-of-keto/">https://www.ketochow.xyz/2015/10/1-year-of-keto/</a>  - Results from eating Keto Chow for all meals for 100 days <a href="https://www.ketochow.xyz/experiment-results/100-days-of-keto-chow-results/">https://www.ketochow.xyz/experiment-results/100-days-of-keto-chow-results/</a></p>
<p>Chocolate uses 12g of cocoa powder per day. Mocha uses 3g of Coffee powder plus 9g of cocoa. Chocolate Peanut Butter uses 30g of the peanut flour and 12g of cocoa.</p>
<p>Check out the Keto Chow subreddit! <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ketochow">https://www.reddit.com/r/ketochow</a></p>
<p>There are prep instructions for this at <a href="https://www.ketochow.xyz/keto-chow-preparation/">https://www.ketochow.xyz/keto-chow-preparation/</a>
I sell 7 days worth of this pre-mixed if you want to give it a try without having to buy all the stuff yourself (and after you&#39;ve tried it, nobody is stopping you from mixing your own if you&#39;d like =) see more at <a href="http://shop.ketochow.xyz/keto-chow/">http://shop.ketochow.xyz/keto-chow/</a></p>
<p>This recipe has the added benefit of being customizable for people with different caloric requirements. Without any oil or cream, it’s right around 500 calories/day and still hits all the right nutrients except protein, and the different fatty acids. Following the directions, you’ll get 1800 calories/day but you can raise or lower that to whatever level you want by changing the amount of heavy cream. It’s super flexible. <a href="https://www.ketochow.xyz/2015/01/customizing-the-calories-in-keto-chow-to-your-requirements/">Instructions Here</a></p>

<p><strong>Changelog</strong></p>
<p><strong>The versions beyond 1.5 aren&#39;t something that could be replicated without industrial scale equipment and ingredients, because of this I&#39;m going to leave 1.5 here and <a href="https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/keto-chow-251-master">fork the recipe over to a new location</a>. Feel free to continue making your own 1.5. You can get <a href="https://www.ketochow.xyz/nutrition/">more details on KC 2.0 over here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>2.5.0 - New logo, new packaging! Introduction of new <a href="https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/keto-chow-25-savory-creamy-tomato-basil">Beef protein flavors</a> with no dairy and no sweeteners.</p>
<p>2.1.2 - Additional Vitamin A to allow complete nutrition while using Avocado Oil instead of Heavy Cream.</p>
<p>2.1.1 - Change from Milk Protein Isolate that uses Sunflower Lecithin to a MPI that does not use any Lecithin</p>
<p><a href="https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/keto-chow-251-master">2.1.0</a> - We are switching from fast absorbing whey protein isolate to slower absorbing milk protein isolate. Milk protein is 20% whey and 80% casein. This comes with several added benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because it’s slower to digest, the casein should reduce the insulin response and should help you feel full longer compared to whey. </li>
<li>Milk protein isolate has a sufficient amount of calcium and phosphorus that we dumped calcium phosphate entirely from the ingredients. </li>
<li>Milk protein has a natural thickening quality, we’ve nearly eliminated xanthan gum and it STILL mixes up thicker compared to earlier versions – you can easily make it thinner by adding more water, though. </li>
<li>Milk protein is a primary product instead of a byproduct of cheese manufacturing. Makes for a more stable supply.</li>
</ul>
<p>Replacing magnesium <strong>citrate</strong> with magnesium <strong>malate</strong> with the total amount of magnesium increased. Citrate can cause digestive issues and a laxidative effect in doses higher than you’d consume with Keto Chow but it’s a better source of magnesium. Less Sucralose – New users tend to complain it’s too salty and keto veterans complain it’s too sweet =) Anyhow we’re changing from 0.1g of pure sucralose per serving to 0.08g (that’s 100mg to 80mg). Other changes to the vitamins and minerals. Replacing the form of selenium, specifically, makes Keto Chow more palatable immediately after mixing. It still tastes better after a night in the fridge, but it’s less “vitaminy” right after mixing.</p>
<p>2.0.2 - Relatively minor change: we are now using Protein Powder that contains Sunflower Lecithin instead of Soy Lecithin. Soy Lecithin doesn’t have any soy protein (it’s generally even safe for people with soybean allergies) but that doesn’t stop people from (frankly) freaking out that something has soy anything in it. Well, that’s no longer an issue =) No more soy on the ingredients, no more soy on the “contains” part of the label!</p>
<p>2.0.1 - Change in the amount of iron – previous versions provided 18mg a day if you did 3 meals of Keto Chow. This is the recommended amount for pre-menopausal women but for post menopausal women or men, that amount is borderline high. 40mg a day is the short-term upper tolerable limit but I didn’t want to be causing a slow build-up of iron (especially in myself =) if Keto Chow was used for all meals over months. The downside to this change is that many women will need to supplement their iron using something <a href="https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/keto-chow-251-master">like this</a>, <a href="https://www.ketochow.xyz/nutrition/">this</a>, or <a href="https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/keto-chow-190-master-rich-chocolate">this</a> in order to prevent anemia if they use Keto Chow exclusively for all their meals. An occasional meal with red meat will also work.</p>
<p>2.0.0 - Over a year in development, eschews off-the-shelf protein powder for custom flavors and fewer carbohydrates. Most flavors are only 0.56g net carbs before adding any heavy cream. Much like 1.9 - the recipe for 2.0.0 isn&#39;t something that could be replicated without industrial scale equipment and ingredients, because of this I&#39;m going to leave 1.5 here and <a href="https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/keto-chow-251-master">fork the recipe over to a new location</a>. Feel free to continue making your own 1.5. You can get <a href="https://www.ketochow.xyz/nutrition/">more details on KC 2.0 over here</a>.</p>
<p>1.9.0 - Final iteration before Keto Chow 2.0 (which will use custom protein and flavoring). 1.9 uses a new custom manufactured vitamin/mineral pre-mix that consolidates a number of the ingredients. I&#39;m also making MCT optional (it&#39;s still awesome for Keto though so I recommend it if your bowels tolerate it). Because creating a custom vitamin pre-mix and ordering several hundred kilograms is outside a normal DIY recipe, I&#39;m going to leave 1.5 here and <a href="https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/keto-chow-190-master-rich-chocolate">fork the recipe over to a new location</a>. Feel free to continue making your own 1.5.</p>
<p>1.5.0 - Yay new version! I&#39;ve switched from Psyllium Husk powder to Acacia Gum fiber (aka &quot;gum arabic&quot;). This has a number of great benefits including being better for your gut bacteria (most people will now be able to trust a fart when starting Keto Chow). Because psyllium husk was also acting as a thickener I&#39;ve increased the xanthan gum. The end result is a nice viscosity with no perceptible texture at all. If you thought Keto Chow 1.0.4 was smooth you should be pleasantly surprised. Since it already had the flavor and now has the texture to match, the &quot;melted icecream&quot; is finally complete! Longer explanation of changes here: <a href="https://www.ketochow.xyz/2016/05/keto-chow-1-5/">https://www.ketochow.xyz/2016/05/keto-chow-1-5/</a></p>
<p>1.0.4 - the LIQUID part of the coconut oil was causing confusion. I&#39;m removing it in favor of just MCT. MK-4 pills have been replaced with MK-7, you still open up one for each day (7 for a week) and add it when mixing together the powder. I&#39;m now grinding the vitamin pills with a blender. 1.53g is how much 1 pill weighs. You can grind yours up and add it to the mixture like I do or you can just take one pill per day.</p>
<p>1.0.3 - reverted 1.0.1 change back to original calcium phosphate, that other one imparted a sandy texture.</p>
<p>1.0.2 - I added in the entry for &quot;Carrington Farms Liquid Coconut Oil&quot; that you can use instead of the MCT. To use it you would change the 0ml to 39ml and then zero out the MCT.</p>
<p>1.0.1 - Minor recipe changes. I changed the Calcium Phosophate to Dicalcium Phosphate with <a href="http://www.bulksupplements.com/dicalcium-phosphate-dcp.html">more accurate mineral content</a> that comes in tiny and massive packages. I also changed the Psyllium Husk to one that comes in little bottles as well as 12lb bulk packs.</p>
<p>1.0 - No changes since 0.7.1 other than deciding it&#39;s awesome and time to come out of beta. I&#39;m going to consider this version good for now (might make some minor modifications in the future, we&#39;ll see).</p>
<p>0.7.1 - removed coconut flour, tweaked protein and upped the xanthan gum just a little. To compensate for the removal of the coconut flour, Psyllium Husk has been increased to 16g</p>
<p>0.7 - Initial release. This is a variant of kennufs-keto-v93 with greatly simplified ingredients.</p>

var targetNutrients = {"descriptionMarkdown":"This profile is based off https://diy.soylent.com/nutrient-profiles/5455bf10c725140200384f8c - here are the notes in that profile\r\n\r\nhttp://www.iom.edu/Activities/Nutrition/SummaryDRIs/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Nutrition/DRIs/5_Summary%20Table%20Tables%201-4.pdf\r\n\r\nThe ratio of carbs / protein / fat has been modified to reflect a lower carb, higher protein balance suitable for healthy weight loss in my individual case; you should likewise adjust to fit your own dietary needs.\r\n\r\nDietary fiber intake is based on the IOM recommendation of 14g / 1,000kcal total energy.\r\n\r\nThe targets for folate, phosphorous, and iodine are set to the IOM's estimated average requirements (rather than the DRI). The max level for Vitamin B6 is set to the IOM's no-observed-adverse-effect level.\r\n\r\nThe data used to establish the IOM's AI for potassium are actually rather weak. After reviewing the limited set of studies they considered, I see no compelling evidence favoring potassium intake in excess of 2.7g per day -- particularly in a dietary setting where sodium intake is tightly controlled (as with soylent).\r\n\r\nThe target ratio of ω-6 to ω-3 PUFA is between 2.3:1 and 1:1 (the standard American diet tends to be much higher). In addition, the ω-6 DRI is significantly reduced based on adequate ω-3 intake. For reference, studies have shown that ω-6 deficiencies are eliminated by 1-2% of calories as LA if the diet has no ω-3 (http://pmid.us/20102846), and by just 0.3% of calories as LA if the diet has over 1% ω-3 (http://pmid.us/14559071). Thus, a little ω-3 in the diet reduces the requirement for ω-6. The upper boundary is based on 10% of total energy from PUFA in all forms, which serves to limit the potential for oxidative stress from excessive PUFA intake (which remains a concern even when taken in carefully protected forms near the ideal ratio of ω-6 to ω-3).\r\n\r\nThe figure for dietary sulfur is derived from the sulfur amino acid (SAA) requirement recommended by WHO: 13 mg/kg per 24 h in healthy adults.","description":"<p>This profile is based off <a href=\"https://diy.soylent.com/nutrient-profiles/5455bf10c725140200384f8c\">https://diy.soylent.com/nutrient-profiles/5455bf10c725140200384f8c</a> - here are the notes in that profile</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.iom.edu/Activities/Nutrition/SummaryDRIs/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Nutrition/DRIs/5_Summary%20Table%20Tables%201-4.pdf\">http://www.iom.edu/Activities/Nutrition/SummaryDRIs/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Nutrition/DRIs/5_Summary%20Table%20Tables%201-4.pdf</a></p>\n<p>The ratio of carbs / protein / fat has been modified to reflect a lower carb, higher protein balance suitable for healthy weight loss in my individual case; you should likewise adjust to fit your own dietary needs.</p>\n<p>Dietary fiber intake is based on the IOM recommendation of 14g / 1,000kcal total energy.</p>\n<p>The targets for folate, phosphorous, and iodine are set to the IOM&#39;s estimated average requirements (rather than the DRI).
