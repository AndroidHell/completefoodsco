Guidelines</strong></h2>
<hr>
<p>This recipe is based on a profile I made using <strong>UK RNI figures</strong> these are quite different from GDA/RDA figures. RNI is recommended daily nutritional intake, meaning this is how much you actually <strong>need</strong> not just an allowance.</p>
<p>It has taken me months to come up with this recipe, it has been through many many versions but I think this recipe is my first one that is ready to be released to the public, so please tell me what you think! I wanted to make something that tastes pleasant (but remaining neutral) and was cheap. I have tried to keep things in a good balance without excess of any particular elements where this is possible. </p>
<p>There is currently only a recipe for Men ages 19-55, I am thinking about making a version for women, older people and pregnant women if the demand is there, if you are interested please leave a comment and I might get to it a bit sooner! Be aware that it is 2500kcal a day, for me with a moderately active life (I don&#39;t exercise on purpose, just a by product of my daily life) that is just right, but if you have a more stationary lifestyle or are prone to weight gain then it might be too much! You can always scale down the recipe to suite your needs.</p>
<p>I have fantasised about being food free since I was about 10. I hate eating and having to waste so much time buying, preparing, and consuming food. My days are always very busy and I will often sacrifice eating so I can carry on with what I am doing without interruption. I have always wanted to be free from eating and be able to really enjoy making and eating food on an occasional basis, say at the weekends, rather than the daily hassle of having to make one of your standard mid week recipes that you don&#39;t care about just because you have to.</p>
<p>So along can Soylent and I have been following it closely for a long time. It sounded perfect but then the price was announced and that put me off big time. My daily spend on food is no where near that much! I eat pretty healthily for the record, lots of fresh veg and the like with meat several times a week. So that gave me the idea of trying my own recipe with the focus on being cheap but without tasting grim. I am also making my own flour from the oats with a cheap blender, if you cant be bothered with that just buy ready made flour but it will put the price up a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Taste and reaction:</strong></p>
<p>It has a reasonable taste, I find it pleasant enough and can drink it without any problem. On its own the taste is of the gram flour but only mild. I have added vanilla to it to good effect also cocoa and instant cheese sauce granules (my current favourite!). I have tried all sorts of flavours and they all work. With the vanilla or chocolate added with a bit of sugar it tastes quite like a milkshake. It is quite smooth apart from a few bits of oats and barley (considering I make my own flour), if you bought ready made flour it would be very smooth. Overall I find it quite neutral and a good base that takes flavour well. It goes down well and doesn&#39;t coat the mouth. It leaves you feeling full and I haven&#39;t experienced any negative reactions to it. I have been consuming it for breakfast and lunch most days and for dinner 4 evenings a week for the last 2 weeks. Overall I feel great, I never feel hungry and I enjoy drinking it. I have loved the freedom it has given me and I feel satisfied most of the day. My weight has been constant, I am less hungry so eat less chocolate and snacks in the evenings.</p>
<p>I recommend starting out with only replacing 1/3 of your daily diet. Like many people I jumped straight in to full replacement and experienced all the signs of increasing my Potassium too quickly! After I switched to gradually increasing the amount of my soylent and the symptoms went away.</p>
<p><strong>Nutritional Information:</strong></p>
<p>I designed my own nutrition profile to base my recipe on. It is the UK figures for nutritional <strong>requirements</strong> not RDA (apart from in a couple of cases where I couldn&#39;t find the data). It also has the maximum figures taken from a paper published in 2003 which details the safe maximum daily intake for each vitamin and mineral. You will see that some of these numbers are much lower than a lot of the other figures on other Soylent DIY profiles. For more information on this have a look at my profile here:</p>

<p>I am still looking for more detailed information for some of the ingredients so I can make my recipe as accurate as possible </p>
<p><strong>Mixing:</strong></p>
<p>As with most soylent DIY you will get the best results by blending the ingredients. To answer the usual question, the specified amounts are 1 days worth, which can be divided up in to as many meals as you like in that 24 hour period. I got a cheap blender for £9.99 and it works perfectly well, I even used it to make the flour for the oats and barley (feel free to buy ready made flours but it puts the price up) I mix it in a cheap mixing bottle, got 3 for £5 off of ebay. My suggestion is to fill the bottle 1/3 with water mix all the dry ingredients (I put my tablets in my coffee grinder first then in the mix but you can take those separately if you want), then the malt extract and the oils, then the rest of the water. You can mix it with as much water as you like but I recommend keeping it quite thin so you have lots of water with it.</p>
<p><strong>A note on some of the tablets:</strong></p>
<p>As you may have seen some of the tablets are very small quantities. The Biotin tablets are at 0.05 per day, this equals 1/4 of a tablet every 5 days. I would like to replace this tablet with a powder but cant source anything suitable, don&#39;t worry too much about getting a perfect quarter, even at 0.05 of a tablet you are still getting 560% of your daily intake so a bit more or less wont matter that much, if you want to make it easier just take .25 of a tablet daily and you will still be well within the maximum range but have bullet proof finger nails and the mane of Samson. The vitamin A tablets are at 0.2 per day which equals 1 tablet every 5 days, again you can take .25 of a tablet and it is well within the maximum. Then the calcium + vitamin D are simply 1/2 a tablet a day. I know this isn&#39;t ideal but it is the best solution at the moment. You could of course crush the tablet and weigh it, then divide it up as necessary if you really wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>Plans for next version:</strong></p>
<p>I have a few things I would like to change in the next version</p>
<ul>
<li>Replace Liquid malt with dried (its a bit of a pain measuring/mixing the liquid as its so thick!).</li>
<li>Replace the Oats with oat flour (unless I can find a way to make a more consistent flour myself).</li>
<li>Replace the Barley with barley flour (unless I can find a......................................................)</li>
<li>Find a better Biotin source that&#39;s in powder form.</li>
<li>Find a better Vitamin A source that&#39;s in powder form.</li>
<li>Look at levels of Omega-3 &amp; 6, too high at the moment.</li>
<li>Try to get closer to my £1 a day goal!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5 days recipe:</strong></p>
<p>Soon!</p>
